<p>But in some blogging niches—self help, personal development, and other emotive categories—&#8221;profound&#8221; is a word that&#8217;s often used to describe posts. I don&#8217;t have any stats on it, but I think profound content is probably more likely to be read all the way through, to encourage comments from readers, and to get shared.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s probably fair to say that profound content draws more readers, and may have a better chance of going viral in some cases. For bloggers, profound content is a worthy goal.</p>
<p>So what is profound? And how can you and I, who may not write on such an emotive level, create &#8220;profound&#8221; content?</p>
<h2>What is &#8220;profound&#8221;?</h2>
<p>I think &#8220;profound&#8221; content usually unravels something for us and make us see that thing in a different light. It takes a common concept or idea—something we take completely for granted—and recasts it so that we can see something new or undiscovered in it.</p>
<p>If you think about it, this is really what Apple does with its products. The idea of a portable colour touchscreen computer may not seem like a massive leap from, say, a laptop. After all, touchscreens were already popular in many applications. But it took Apple to recast what we saw as &#8220;computers&#8221; and &#8220;computing&#8221; in the form of an iPad for people to sit up and say, &#8220;yeah, that&#8217;s great!&#8221;, and to use it, and love it.</p>
<p>I think this is pretty much the definition of &#8220;profound.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Making profound content</h2>
<p>A profound idea is, I think, the basis for profound content. You need to start by thinking—though I&#8217;m sure many ideas come from an &#8220;ah-ha&#8221; moment, the fact is that even those sparks of inspiration take mental energy.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I think there are probably several writing techniques that can make or break your profound content.</p>
<h3>1. Clarity</h3>
<p>The clarity of your expression is important in communicating a profound concept. The aim is likely to be to communicate what you need to with as few words as possible. This leaves the reader the mental space to take in the information and digest it as they read.</p>
<p>So avoiding lengthy, repetitive descriptions, unnecessary humour or undue seriousness, is important. A post doesn&#8217;t need to be &#8220;weighty&#8221; to be profound, but it does need to be <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2012/06/snark-and-fear.html">effortlessly comprehensible</a>.</p>
<p>Above all, make sure that every word in your profound post is necessary—that every word counts.</p>
<h3>2. Length</h3>
<p>Some posts are profound because they say so much in so little space—if you <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/DalaiLama">follow The Dalai Lama on Twitter</a>, you&#8217;ll know what I mean.</p>
<p>The shorter the post, the more pithy it&#8217;s likely to be. That <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/facebook_likes">doesn&#8217;t mean a longer post can&#8217;t be profound</a>, but it probably does mean that sentences are likely to be short, and the overall post contains no fluff.</p>
<h3>3. Word choice</h3>
<p>I think the most profound posts communicate, so that means the words you choose for the post need to be easily understood by all readers.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean you need to &#8220;dumb down&#8221; your post, but a profound post is usually one that, as I mentioned above, <a href="http://www.dooce.com/2012/05/31/blog-about-cantaloupe">takes little to no effort to comprehend</a>. So word choice is important. Make your posts as accessible as possible by <a href="http://zenhabits.net/imagine/">using words that your readers won&#8217;t struggle to understand</a>—that will allow them to focus upon your message, and give their full attention to what you&#8217;re communicating.</p>
<h3>4. Formatting</h3>
<p>A trend I see often on blogs is that of using formatting to emphasise &#8220;profound&#8221; or meaningful points within a post. We might separate already-short sentences onto separate lines, bold them, or italicize certain words in them.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s fine, but it&#8217;s important to remember that formatting doesn&#8217;t make for profundity. More often than not, I see it used to draw attention to points that, if the blogger had taken more care with the text of the post itself, would happily stand alone and have impact without formatting.</p>
<p>If you craft the post well, you may not ned to use formatting to drive your points home at all. A <a href="http://www.stratejoy.com/2012/06/mothers-and-daughters-2/">truly profound post draws readers through its length</a> by virtue of its power.</p>
<h2>Do you have a profound post?</h2>
<p>Is there a post in your niche that fits the description of &#8220;profound&#8221;? Share it with us in the comments so we can take a look and get a feel for how profound content works in different situations.</p>

<p>You try telling Martha Stewart she needs to pick a niche.</p>
<p>So why is everyone in the blogosphere telling you that doing just that is the key to achieving any level of success in blogging?</p>
<p>True, it is <em>easier</em> to build and write a popular blog when you stick to one topic. But now more than ever, there is an opening for multi-topic blogs to hit it big, if they do it right. Wait, you don&#8217;t see the opening? That&#8217;s funny, it has a big flashing sign pointing the way.</p>
<p>That sign says &#8220;Pinterest.&#8221;</p>
<h2>What is Pinterest?</h2>
<p>If I need to tell you what <a href="http://pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a> is, I&#8217;d be mildly concerned that you have been in a coma for the last six months. But what is it <em>about</em>?</p>
<p>Pinterest is about collecting. People love to collect things. In the big wide world of the internet, this impulse is no different. As a matter of fact, it can be <em>amplified</em>.</p>
<p>Pinterest is where people collect pretty much everything they like from all around the internet and pin it to categorized and organized virtual pinboards. Each &#8220;Pin&#8221; is a nice large image with a description, which tickles our visual cortexes ever so nicely.</p>
<p>People &#8230; who are totally not me &#8230; have been known to spend entire days off getting lost in the inspiration. With Pinterest, you can visually create the life you are planning on living as soon as you get the time and money to do so.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m talking about lifestyle, folks.</p>
<h2>What is the Pinterest niche?</h2>
<p>The Pinterest niche, as this writer seems to have coined it, is the wide-open lifestyle area. Much of Pinterest, and therefore the Pinterest niche, centers around DIY (as in, things you can make).</p>
<p>The most popular topics on Pinterest, and in the niche, are Home, Arts &amp; Crafts, Style/Fashion, and Inspiration/Education, according to <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/03/12/pinterest-most-popular-categories-boards/" target="_blank">Mashable</a>. While those are the <em>most</em> popular, there tons of other topics to choose from as well—the Wedding category is also immensely repinned.</p>
<p>Because there are so many good topics to choose from, Pinterest niche blogs are not difficult to differentiate from each other. All you need is a focus. We walked though <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2012/07/07/weekend-project-1-fix-a-mess-of-a-multi-topic-blog/">how to find your focus for a multi-topic blog</a> yesterday. Now let&#8217;s get to some real-life examples.</p>
<p>The blogs selected here were chosen not necessarily because they are the biggest and baddest on the block. Some are run by whole teams of staff, some by one little ol&#8217; person. Some have been established for a number of years, while some are newer on the scene.</p>
<p>What they have in common are all of the elements it takes to make an impact in the Pinterest niche. So what are these elements? Who better to show you than the Grand Dame of the Pinterest blogs, Martha Stewart.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Martha-Stewart-580x386.jpg"><img src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Martha-Stewart-580x386.jpg" alt="Martha Stewart blog" title="Martha Stewart blog " width="580" height="386" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22303" /></a></p>
<h3>A strong personality</h3>
<p>A blog centered around a lifestyle, as Pinterest niche blogs are, need a face to associate with that lifestyle.</p>
<p>Martha Stewart has this so wrapped up that when you even think about homemaking, hers is the first face that springs to mind. She may run a media empire, live a life so beautiful it can make one green with envy, and have more prison street cred than some rappers, but when your mind turns to homespun craftiness, you think of Martha.</p>
<h3>A strong message</h3>
<p>Martha gives her readers and followers tools to simplify and beautify their homes and their lives through the power of DIY.</p>
<h3>A super-specific customer avatar</h3>
<p>All of Martha Stewart&#8217;s work is geared toward moms with kids and pets. They are a little older, settled down, and they own homes.They enjoy entertaining, gardening, cooking, crafting, and simply making their lives more beautiful.</p>
<h3>Incredibly helpful and informative</h3>
<p>I hardly have to mention how much how-to power Martha Stewart packs into her website, blogs, books and magazines. She has literally written the book(s) on homemaking.</p>
<h3>Beautiful photography</h3>
<p>Although Martha Stewart&#8217;s photography resources are nearly unlimited these days, her photography has always been top notch.</p>
<p>The good news is, with as little as a smartphone, paired with a little creativity and practice, anyone can take beautiful photos these days.</p>
<h2>5 Great Pinterest blogs</h2>
<p>Now let&#8217;s explore five innovative multi-topic Pinterest niche blogs, including those all-important five secrets, the important stats, and what they are doing so well.</p>
<h3>1. <a href="http://hellogiggles.com" target="_blank">Hello Giggles</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Hello-Giggles-580x386.jpg"><img src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Hello-Giggles-580x386.jpg" alt="Hello Giggles blog" title="Hello Giggles blog" width="580" height="386" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22304" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Personality:</em> Founded by Zooey Deschanel and two friends, Hello Giggles has some serious starpower behind it in the indie darling. She is known to have coined the phrase &#8220;Adorkable.&#8221;</li>
<li><em>Message:</em> Entertaining and empowering inspiration for young women. Girly feminism, if you will.</li>
<li><em>Reader:</em> Young women in their &#8220;finding themselves&#8221; phase of life.</li>
<li><em>How they help:</em> Hello Giggles features tons of reader-submitted work and guest posts on a huge range of topics and creates a positive, female-friendly environment for reader interaction.</li>
<li><em>Photography:</em> A combination of professional and reader-submitted photography keeps the look of the site both polished and approachable.</li>
<li><em>Topics:</em> Entertainment, Treats, Beauty, Cuteness, Home, Social Issues, Opinion, Parenting, Humor and more.</li>

<li><em>Bloglovin&#8217; Followers:</em> 3,138</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Secret:</strong> Besides the starpower behind the blog, the best thing Hello Giggles has going for it is its feel-good factor. It absolutely oozes &#8220;Yes you can,&#8221; and that is what keeps its readers coming back.</p>
<h3>2. <a href="http://abeautifulmess.typepad.com/" target="_blank">A Beautiful Mess</a></h3>

<ul>
<li><em>Personality:</em> Perhaps it is no coincidence that the force behind A Beautiful Mess looks so much like Zooey Deschanel. Elsie, however, is more vintage indie than cute and dorky indie. She is always incredibly positive and upbeat, and lets you inside her life, home and business in such a way that readers powerfully connect with her.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Secret:</strong> Elsie (and her sister Emma) over at A Beautiful Mess own a vintage clothing boutique called Red Velvet. While their business may be clothing, the blog is all about inspiration for the vintage, indie lifestyle. Elsie lives and displays the beautiful life her readers aspire to, and shows them how to create it.</p>
<h2>3. <a href="http://cupcakesandcashmere.com/" target="_blank">Cupcakes and Cashmere</a></h2>

<h2>4. <a href="http://daintysquid.blogspot.com" target="_blank">The Dainty Squid</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/The-Dainty-Squid-580x385.jpg"><img src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/The-Dainty-Squid-580x385.jpg" alt="The Dainty Squid blog" title="The Dainty Squid blog" width="580" height="385" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22307" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Personality:</em> Brightly colored hair does have a certain draw, and Kaylah the thrifting queen, amateur mycologist, cat lady, and collector of many many things goes through so many shades. She also has a cat named Dr. Octopus that lets her dress him up. Full of personality, this one.</li>

<li><em>Facebook Fans:</em> 5,241</li>
<li><em>Bloglovin&#8217; Followers:</em> 3,350</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Secret:</strong> It is all about the personality. Kaylah is a shy girl (she even says so on her about page), and that is the kind of reader she attracts. The fact that she is so bright and colorful and outgoing on her blog is an inspiration to her readers, and she shows them step by step how to bring her carefully curated aesthetic into their lives.</p>

<p>The love spiral would continue until the internet was throwing money at you like a pre-fame Channing Tatum up on stage. And yet&#8230;</p>
<p>Your traffic numbers are decent, but people aren&#8217;t sticking around on your blog. They aren&#8217;t interacting, with you or each other.</p>
<p>They certainly aren&#8217;t subscribing. Your readers aren&#8217;t connecting, and you aren&#8217;t helping.</p>
<p>So you scour the big meta blogs (blogs about blogging) for advice. They all tell you that to be successful in the blogosphere, you need to niche down and specialize. Micro-niche, even.</p>
<p>Here are five posts by very savvy and successful bloggers that will tell you all of the reasons why you should pick a topic and stick to it.</p>

</ul>
<p>It makes sense, right? Less clutter, more focus. It&#8217;s business 101.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s get real, shall we?</p>
<p>You. Don&#8217;t. Wanna.</p>
<p>Anyone who has caught an episode of <a href="http://www.aetv.com/hoarders/" target="_blank">Hoarders</a> knows they these people don&#8217;t set out to have the mess in their homes eat them alive. They really do have the best of intentions. They love these belongings so much they cannot bear to part with any of them.</p>
<p>Although real-life hoarders are an extreme example, in a way, you understand them. You love each of your topics like one of your hoarder feral cat children. You know that to have a happy, balanced blog and life, you need to simplify and get back to basics.</p>
<p>But again, you don&#8217;t wanna. Your blog is <em>you</em>. It is your home, where you keep all of your most precious projects, ideas and musings. So you plod along, scattered and disorganized, believing that your passion will shine through and earn you a loyal following.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not going to happen. Blogs without focus do not have sticking power. They will not encourage readers to engage, and they will not make you money.</p>
<p>After all, how is anyone going to connect to your blog and stick around if they aren&#8217;t even sure what you do? Are you even sure?</p>
<p>If you suddenly found yourself standing in an elevator with Darren and he asked you what your blog was about, would you be able to tell him before your short ride was over? More importantly, would he exit those doors interested in knowing more?</p>
<p>If you cannot sum up your blog—what it is about, what you do and who you are—in a nice, succinct <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2009/04/06/write-an-elevator-pitch-for-your-blog-day-1-31dbbb/" target="_blank">elevator pitch</a>, you probably have a big, idea hoarding mess of a multi-topic blog on your hands.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m here to help you clean it up. That&#8217;s right. You can have your blog, and make it work, too. Consider this your intervention.</p>
<h2>Let&#8217;s get to work</h2>
<p>To make your multi-topic blog focused and relatable, I will walk you through five steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Taking a blog inventory</li>
<li>Creating a customer avatar of your ìOneî reader</li>
<li>A little self-analysis</li>
<li>Keep, Sell, Toss</li>
<li>Finding your unifying thread.</li>
</ol>
<p>After that, we get to put it all together. Are you ready? Here we go.</p>
<h2>1. Take an inventory</h2>
<p>Before you can figure out what you need, you have to figure out what you have. Start by making a list of all of your main topics or categories. Now go through your posts and find out two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which categories seem to be most popular with your readers? You can use post comment counts, page views, or whatever metric works for you.</li>
<li>Which categories are the most filled out? While you may love all of your topics, there are bound to be some you do not write about as often as others.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rank your categories in order from best to worst, but do not ditch any under-performing categories just yet.</p>
<h2>2. Weed out your one perfect customer/reader</h2>
<p>Much has been written lately in blogland about messaging and customer avatars. The idea is to write as if you are writing to only one person in the world.</p>
<p>Even if many of your real live readers do not precisely match this avatar, your messaging is clear, focused, and personal. That is what makes a blog great to read.</p>
<p>Danny Inny over at Firepole Marketing wrote an <a href="http://www.firepolemarketing.com/blog/2011/04/30/customer-profiles/" target="_blank">incredibly insightful post</a> about this, complete with a beautiful checklist for finding your <em>one</em> perfect reader. You can get it for free by tweeting or sharing the page, and I highly encourage you to do so.</p>
<p>This is the sticking point for a multi-topic blog, isn&#8217;t it? Because you have so many topics, you have essentially been writing for everybody! How are you going to be able to narrow down your ideal reader traits to a single avatar? Relax, you don&#8217;t have to. Initially.</p>
<p>Instead, pretend that you have split each category of your blog from the previous exercise up into its own niche site, independent of the others.</p>
<p>Write out a customer profile for each niche, using Danny&#8217;s checklist. Do this for each of your main topics. Make a spreadsheet if you like.</p>
<p>Now look for similar customer traits between each of your niches. Do you see any patterns jumping out? Age, marital status, kids, interests, professions? Make a list of any traits that occur more than once, and how often.</p>
<p>At this point, you can start constructing your overall reader profile—the kind of reader that really does love and connect with all of the random things you write about.</p>
<p>But we&#8217;re not done yet. Now it&#8217;s time to breathe life into your ideal reader.</p>
<h2>3. Analyze yourself</h2>
<p>The common thread to pulling an unorganized blog together, surprisingly, is often found in you.</p>
<p>Pull up Danny&#8217;s customer profile sheet again. Fill it out again, answering these questions for you personally.</p>
<p>Using both your own profile and the list of most common traits, you can begin to cobble together a much more accurate profile of your ideal reader.</p>
<p>After all, you are writing this blog based on your own passions and experiences, correct? Why shouldn&#8217;t your ideal reader include a bit of yourself?</p>
<p>You see, that&#8217;s where the connection happens.</p>
<h2>4. Keep, sell, toss</h2>
<p>Now it&#8217;s time for the hard part. Just like any hoarder rehab, you are going to have to let some things go.</p>
<p><strong>Keep:</strong> Set your new reader profile and your Inventory from Step 1 in front of you. Do any of your best-performing topics fit your reader profile particularly well? Good! Those are your absolute keeper topics.</p>
<p><strong>Sell:</strong> If you have the time (and understandably, not many of us do) consider splitting off a topic or two that does not fit your blog into a separate blog.</p>
<p><strong>Toss:</strong> Now you have to get ruthless. You&#8217;re going to have to do some soul-searching and figure out which extraneous topics you can let go. Chances are there will be one that you just can&#8217;t bear to part with. In that case&#8230;</p>
<h2>5. Find your thread</h2>
<p>Maybe that is your thread.</p>
<p>Perhaps you write a blog about crafts, DIY, cooking, gardening, hair, beauty, photography, wellness, and more. You have gotten rid of your Haute Couture and Blogging sections, but the one you cannot bear to let go is video games. Your love of <a href="http://www.mmorpg.com/" target="_blank">MMORPGs</a> is too intense.</p>
<p>Things just got real specific, folks.</p>
<p>Maybe your thread is craft-loving fantasy geeks. And boy are there a lot of them out there. Just look at anything <a href="https://twitter.com/feliciaday/" target="_blank">Felicia Day</a> posts on social media.</p>
<h2>Put it all together: picture your publication</h2>
<p>Everything is falling into place now. All the junk is cleared away, and the hoarder house is clean. Now you just have to put it all together so that you don&#8217;t lose your way ever again.</p>
<p>With what you now know about your reader and your topics, it&#8217;s time to find your <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2012/05/16/get-obsessed-with-your-message/" target="_blank">message</a>.</p>
<p>Your blog is an online publication. Start treating it that way. Sure, it may be personal, but it&#8217;s also your business (or so I would assume—you are reading <em>Pro</em>blogger, after all).</p>
<p>Publications, like books and magazines, have to have a flow, a layout, or in the case of magazines, an editorial calendar.</p>
<p>Right now I only want you to picture your blog as a book. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you want to write a book eventually or not. For this exercise, you do (and after this, it might not be a bad idea!).</p>
<p>Why a book and not a magazine? Magazines are ongoing, with constantly updated content, and are certainly more akin to how a blog works. But books have permanence. They can stand the test of time. And isn&#8217;t that what you want your blog to be?</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the title of your book? Maybe a subtitle too!</li>
<li>Mentally (or physically) design your book cover.</li>
<li>How would you divide up the chapters and sections?</li>
<li>Write your book jacket copy. What is your book about, and how can it help that ideal reader of yours?</li>
</ul>
<p>And now, just like on any good <a href="http://www.aetv.com/" target="_blank">A&amp;E</a> show, the big reveal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your book title? <em>That&#8217;s your new tagline.</em></li>
<li>Your book cover? <em>That is what your pages should look like.</em></li>
<li>Your chapters and sections? <em>Let them guide how you organize your site&#8217;s pages and menus.</em></li>
<li>You jacket copy? <em>That&#8217;s your message.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Extra credit: guest posting</h2>
<p>Even after all of this, I know there are some topics that you will have trouble letting go. Take heart, because you don&#8217;t have to.</p>
<p>When you have items that you don&#8217;t have room to keep in your home, what do you get? A storage locker, a.k.a. guest posts.</p>
<p>Keep writing those posts on topics that you love, but do not fit with your blog. The trick is to keep your overall message in mind when you write—not your ideal reader, but your message.</p>
<p>The idea with these guest posts is to pitch them to blogs that you enjoy, but are not the ideal reader of. This post is one such example.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure the ideal Problogger reader is not a 29-year-old barber stepmom, obsessed with Martha Stewart, wishing she lived in Rivendell. And that reader almost certainly does not frequently sport a peacock-colored mohawk. And yet&#8230;</p>
<h2>What it all means</h2>
<p>Like hoarders, we bloggers can get so used to the mess we see around us that we lose all objectivity as to the impression our blog makes on new readers. With every additional topic you cover, it gets exponentially more difficult.</p>
<p>The key is focus. If you follow the process I have outlined in this post, I guarantee that you will arrive at a clear and accurate customer avatar, strong unifying thread and clear, compelling message.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I will be back to show you <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2012/07/08/weekend-project-2-5-success-secrets-of-multi-topic-blogs/">five blogs that have mastered the ability to convey a clear, strong brand</a> while juggling a wide variety of topics—and I&#8217;ll clue you in to their five secrets to killing it in the Pinterest niche.</p>

This is a point that I&#8217;ve made many times, and it&#8217;s advice I still stand by.</p>
<p>That said, there are many, many bloggers out there with multi-topic blogs who aren&#8217;t about to &#8220;niche down&#8221; any time soon. They love their blogs, topics, and readers too much to narrow their focus. Take, for example, <a href="http://dooce.com">Dooce</a>. It&#8217;s not just a multi-topic blog, it&#8217;s a personal blog too—and one that&#8217;s monetized. Also, it&#8217;s just one of millions. </p>
<p>So there are plenty of bloggers out there who thoroughly enjoy multi-topic blogging, and many are making a living from it.</p>
<p>This weekend is designed for them: we have a weekend project that will help all the multi-topic bloggers out there get their blogs in order, help them focus on those topics they love, and assist them to gain more readers and followers through more creative, strategic thinking.</p>
<p>Though it seems like this weekend project is just for multi-topic bloggers, I have the feeling it&#8217;ll help any blogger who has more than one content category on their site. Like me, you might have been running your focused blog for a few years, and you might be finding that a topic spring-clean and strategic re-focus might help. </p>
<p>In that case, this weekend project is also perfect for you.</p>
<p><strong>Today&#8217;s article, the first part in the series</strong> walks you through the process of conducting a topic inventory, and working out where your passions lie, who your readers are, who <em>you</em> are, and how you should focus your efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Tomorrow&#8217;s article, the second part</strong>, looks at the way multi-topic blogs can really excel on certain platforms. Author and blogger Natalie Webb will profile five multi-topic blogs that are making the most out of Pinterest (as well as other social platforms). It&#8217;s an intriguing case study even for those with the most niche-specific blogs.</p>
<p>I think you&#8217;ll find this a really intriguing project. And if you have—or have ever had—a multi-topic blog, we&#8217;d love to hear about it in the comments. What&#8217;s your blog about? How long has it been going and where&#8217;s it heading? Share your stories with us in preparation for the first post, which will publish later today.</p>

<p>So you got your blog started up. It&#8217;s time to put everything in place.</p>
<p>You start to study the market and conduct all the research needed. You read up on other blogs, scout forums, and buy an ebook that&#8217;s supposed to help you succeed.</p>
<p>Having bought into the hype, you actually force yourself to apply all the tactics you learnt, even though you don&#8217;t have a good feeling about them.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re basically basing your work on others&#8217; success!</p>
<p>Already you&#8217;ve fallen into the category of tired bloggers who&#8217;ve tried everything and yet not seen any success. And then you&#8217;re attracted by other &#8220;gurus&#8221; who advertise &#8220;the real deal&#8221;. It&#8217;s a vicious cycle.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s lacking? What is that one, invisible quality that the top bloggers all seem to have? You may be spending too much time doing what others are doing, when the real problem is this:</p>
<h2>Your blog lacks your &#8220;why&#8221;</h2>
<p>How much energy are you expending on your blog? I don&#8217;t just mean writing, designing, optimizing SEO, or using social media.</p>
<p>I mean how much of <em>yourself</em> are you putting into your blog?</p>
<p>The power of your self, injected in your blog, can take you far. It&#8217;s about bringing forth your beliefs to the world and sharing your vision with people.</p>
<p>And it all fuses together to create your &#8220;why&#8221;.</p>
<blockquote><p>The goal is not to do business with everybody who needs what you have. The goal is to do business with people who believe what you believe.”—Simon Sinek, <a href="http://www.startwithwhy.com/">Start with Why</a></p></blockquote>
<p>This attitude goes beyond merely following your passion and showing people you&#8217;re doing what you love. It&#8217;s also a step ahead of putting personality in your writing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the belief and vision you need to create your purpose. And with purpose, you&#8217;ll never be lost again.</p>
<h2>How to find and express your blog&#8217;s essence</h2>
<h3>1. Find your own purpose in person</h3>
<p>In order to find your blog&#8217;s essence, you&#8217;ve first got to find your own purpose in life.</p>
<p>Remember, your blog is you. You aren&#8217;t a ball of marketing tactics and business strategies. You need to continually express yourself in your blog to get all that essence out there.</p>
<p>I found and fine-tuned my purpose with <a href="http://ryzeonline.com/how-to-have-fun-finding-your-life-purpose-with-pretty-pictures">this little exercise</a> I did at RyzeOnline. This powerful exercise can help you to zoom in on your very being, building the strong roots needed for both yourself and your blog.</p>
<p>Furthermore, one of the things the exercise teaches is to be fully proud of your essence and loudly proclaim it to the world. You can easily do that by writing and portraying that on your About Me page, and in all your articles.</p>
<p>Ever since I completed this exercise, I&#8217;ve only written with purpose. To put it another way, I don&#8217;t write if I&#8217;m not inspired. I stopped churning out content just for the sake of having an update for my blog. Not only does it feel a lot better, but my articles have been receiving greater response in terms of comments.</p>
<p>Do the exercise now to create your blog&#8217;s roots.</p>
<h3>2. Find your one person</h3>
<p>Now, with your purpose and essence found, you need to as yourself: who will I bring this to?</p>
<p>Forget about finding a target audience or a demographic. Ask yourself this: </p>
<p>&#8220;Are you being completely you when having an intimate conversation with someone or when you&#8217;re addressing a large group?&#8221; You should be.</p>
<p>There is a fantastic article on finding your one person (or customer) over at <a href="http://www.firepolemarketing.com/blog/2011/04/30/customer-profiles/">Firepole Marketing</a>, complete with a free worksheet.</p>
<p>Finding your one person makes it a lot easier for you and your blog to communicate your essence. It relieves the pressure of marketing and managing your entire blog.</p>
<p>For me now, when I write, everything is directed to my one person. And combining it with the first point—my why—I know for sure I&#8217;m on the right track.</p>
<p>So find your one person now, and write, blog, and talk to <em>them</em>.</p>
<h3>3. Find your blog&#8217;s one true design</h3>
<p>Every blog has a layout and design—otherwise it&#8217;s just a wall of words.</p>
<p>But does your blog visually scream your essence?</p>
<p>Good marketing for a blog would mean readers would know what you&#8217;re all about within just three seconds of landing on your page.</p>
<p>Your content and writing definitely plays a big role, but the fact is, people&#8217;s attention span fluctuate a lot, so you definitely have to get your blog&#8217;s look alone to grab attention. And when you do grab it, make sure the right messages are going through.</p>
<p><a href="http://zenhabits.net/">Zenhabits</a> has a minimalist look and it works wonderfully. <a href="http://www.firepolemarketing.com/blog/">Firepole Marketing</a>, with its tagline, &#8220;Marketing that works&#8221; easily tells us of the brand&#8217;s speciality in marketing.</p>
<p>I just went through a <a href="http://alden-tan.com/">blog revamp</a> myself. When I started out, I thought of taking pretty pictures of myself with a good camera, thinking that it would look good anyway. Now, the pictures of me easily tell of my life. Let me know if you get that.</p>
<p>Does your blog visually tell your story? If not, tweak it!</p>
<h2>People will recognize your blog for you</h2>
<p>When I started my own blog, I just thought I&#8217;d write and see what comes along, because I knew I was a good writer. But I ended up writing random articles that were at most entertaining.</p>
<p>It was only when I dug deeper into myself and find out why I wanted to blog that I found real purpose in blogging.</p>
<p>Not only does it feel good doing what I do everyday, but people eventually recognized me for that. I got personal emails from readers asking me for real advice. And all my &#8220;winning&#8221; strategic platforms thrive on their own—now I have more Twitter followers, more Facebook likes and more opt-ins.</p>
<p>Are you a little sceptical in the importance of essence? Essence is not some magical, cosmic energy at work in which the universe rewards you for the passion you have. It&#8217;s just building a strong foundation in your blog or business.</p>
<p>Remember, with strong roots, your blog will bear great fruit. And what better way to build your roots than by being yourself, being passionate, and being original?</p>

<blockquote><p>“There’s a sucker born every minute.”—P. T. Barnum <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There's_a_sucker_born_every_minute">*Note.</a></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“They apparently all have Internet access.”—S. A. Lowe</p></blockquote>
<p>Rubix D. Newby—Rube to his friends—left the family farm to strike it rich in the Big City. On the road he happened upon a garish collection of tents and lights.</p>
<p>A circus!</p>
<p>But not just any old circus, this was the famous Internet Marketing Circus. He scurried towards the gate. Fishing in his pocket, he wondered if he had enough money to get inside.</p>
<p>An old man by the gate whispered “No money required to get in, son, but best keep a hand in your pocket anyway.” The T-shirt he was wearing was faded and barely legible. “<a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2011/10/28/the-secret-to-explosive-blog-growth/">The Secret is Free</a>,” it said.</p>
<p>The barker in front of the gate was wearing a black tuxedo with tails and a top hat. The top hat jiggled back and forth as the barker shouted into a megaphone.</p>
<p>“Step right up folks, and be amazed!” he cried. “Ladies, and gentlemen, young and old, draw near and listen as the story unfolds! Opportunities for riches beyond your wildest dreams await you online through Internet Marketing schemes! So step inside, where gurus and ninjas await! With secrets and contraptions that will never abate! With these treasures and tricks you can build a fortune online! No effort! No labor! All in your spare time!”</p>
<p>The barker pointed his megaphone right at Rube. “The sky’s the limit on how much money you earn, but what is the limit on the <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2012/05/19/blog-better-by-slowing-down/">time you can burn</a>? So step right up, and go on in, it’s not MLM so you don’t even need to bring a friend!”</p>
<p>Rube flowed with the crowd through the gate, mesmerized by the bouquet of booths, tents, rides, barkers, hawkers, carnies, signs, lights, sounds, smells, and promises inside. &#8220;Where to begin!?&#8221; he thought.</p>
<p>While Rube was gawking at the spectacle, a furtive young man dressed all in black and wearing a strange sword caught his attention. “Psst!” said the young man, “Have I got a deal for you!”</p>
<p>“Oh?” said Rube. “What is it?”</p>
<p>“Why, it’s a push-button cash machine <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2011/07/22/how-to-build-community-for-niche-site-success/">niche site</a> generator!” he said.</p>
<p>“Oh?” said Rube. “What good is that?”</p>
<p>“What good is it?” asked the man. “Why, it’s my own secret ninja guru formula and system guaranteed to bring you unlimited cash flow, practically overnight!”</p>
<p>“How interesting,” said Rube. “What do I have to do to make it work?”</p>
<p>“That’s the beauty of it!” said the man. “You just pick a niche by following my simple yet comprehensive formula, using a few tools that I conveniently provide for a small fee, then just push a button to automagically generate a web site that starts making you money instantly! And for a limited time, I am willing to sell this to you and only you for $97!”</p>
<p>Rube knew he didn’t have $97. “Not interested,” he said, and started to walk away.</p>
<p>“Wait!” the man said. “Just because I like you and don’t want you to miss out on this spectacular opportunity, you can have it for $7!”</p>
<p>Rube stepped in something. &#8220;Must be elephants around here,&#8221; he thought.</p>
<p>Rube laughed. “Mister, if I had a magic cash machine I wouldn’t sell it for any price, I’d just push that button over and over and over!”</p>
<p>The man suddenly vanished into the crowd. Rube had a sneaking suspicion and reached into his pocket. One of his dollars had gone missing.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a strange fellow,&#8221; thought Rube, wiping off his shoes in the straw.</p>
<p>Rube noticed a crowd gathering around a man wearing a suit covered in neon dollar signs, gesturing at a large circular device. He shook the straw off of his feet and shuffled over to the back of the crowd.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2009/02/22/smart-article-marketing-for-fast-and-long-term-blog-traffic/">Article marketing</a> is the true secret sauce for building authority!” the man shouted through a megaphone. “A thousand articles on ten thousand sites and you’ll be an authority practically overnight!”</p>
<p>“That sounds like a lot of work,” Rube yelled over everyone’s heads.</p>
<p>“Ah, my friend,” replied the man, pushing through the crowd, “ordinarily it would be!” He draped one arm around Rube’s shoulders, and steered him towards the strange device. “But not if you have this magical Spinner! Care to give it a try? Five spins for a dollar! Lifetime use for only $97! Step up and speak a few words into the magic funnel.”</p>
<p>“Well, okay, I’ll try it,” said Rube. He gave the man a dollar, and considered what to say. “The effect is amazing!” he said.</p>
<p>The machine whirred and spun and spouted great gouts of flame and billows of smoke, then intoned “The outcome is astounding!” “The consequence is impressive!” “Extraordinary is the result!” “Amazed by the effect, you will be!” “Become awestruck by substantial ramifications!”</p>
<p>The spinning and the smoke made Rube a bit nauseous. He was glad he only paid for five spins, as they were starting to sound rather silly.</p>
<p>Rube thanked the man and wandered away. Soon he noticed another barker in front of a dark tent. The man was dressed up like a spider.</p>
<p>“Master the web! Feel important! Instant <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2009/08/05/how-to-grow-your-authority-essential-reading-for-bloggers/">authority</a>!” hollered the spider-barker. “Superstar rankings! Fully automated mega backlink generation!” he continued.</p>
<p>Rube still felt a bit ill from the spinning, and was becoming somewhat disenchanted with the circus. But, he still had one dollar. &#8220;Surely one of these things has got to work,&#8221; he thought.</p>
<p>“I could use some instant authority,” said Rube, and handed the spider-barker his last dollar.</p>
<p>“Excellent choice, son,” said the barker. “Nothing builds authority faster than a thousand carefully-chosen backlinks! Just take the lighted path to the center of the tent, and prepare to be amazed!”</p>
<p>Rube stepped through the entry way and followed a dimly-lit path to the center of the tent. A spotlight snapped on as he stepped up on a small pedestal.</p>
<p>“Speak your mind, and let your authority be recognized!” intoned a disembodied voice.</p>
<p>Rube thought for a moment, and then said, “Farming is hard work!”</p>
<p>A fanfare of music swelled, and the lights started to rise. Rube saw that he was surrounded by bleachers, but they were empty.</p>
<p>As the illumination increased, Rube heard the screech of rusty gears, and noticed an odd bellows-like machine at the top of the tent. “Commencing generation of massive authority-building backlinks!” shouted the voice. The machine sprayed something onto the bleachers with a loud Hroof! and a Hurrrm!</p>
<p>Now the bleachers were no longer empty, but were covered in …ants! There were thousands of them, arrayed around him in neat concentric circles.</p>
<p>As the lights reached full glare, the screeching stopped and all was quiet. Suddenly, all of the ants pointed at him and whispered, “Farming is hard work!”</p>
<p>This did make Rube feel important—for a moment. &#8220;But they are just ants,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;And they seem to be dead.&#8221; He was very disappointed, and headed directly for the exit. He crunched over a few hundred ants on the way out.</p>
<p>&#8220;This circus is not fun,&#8221; Rube thought. &#8220;And now I’m broke. Might as well go back to the farm.&#8221; He dejectedly shuffled back towards the gate.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I’m not cut out for this Internet Marketing thing,’ he ruminated. &#8220;It&#8217;s too complicated, and costs too much money—and seems to be run by some very strange people!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lost in thought, he stumbled into a sign that had only two words: “Simple Truth.” The sign was in front of a plain table with two chairs. Sitting in one of the chairs was the old man from the gate, except now his T-shirt read: “There is no ninja sauce”. The old man gestured at Rube to take a seat.</p>
<p>“I got no more dollars,” Rube told the old man.</p>
<p>“Don’t need ‘em,” he replied.</p>
<p>“Then what do you want?” asked Rube.</p>
<p>“I want you to succeed,” he said. “Have a seat.”</p>
<p>Rube sat. The old man continued, “So, your money’s gone, is it? Went broke fast trying to get rich quick, eh?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I guess I don’t understand this stuff; best give up,” Rube said.</p>
<p>“There is another way,” the old man said. “It’s not flashy, it’s not sexy, it’s not overnight, and it’s not a fully-automated push-button solution guaranteed to bring you loads of cash on autopilot while you sleep for only $97 per month. But it always works, and it costs nothing but time—and motivation. Oh sure, you can accelerate the process some if you spend wisely, but the knowledge and tools are essentially free.”</p>
<p>“What is it?” asked Rube.</p>
<p>The old man chuckled. “It’s called ‘Getting Educated’. Learn the fundamentals. Internet marketing is not about tricks and gimmicks, it’s about serving people. It’s about relating to prospects and customers online the same way you would relate to them in person. That means finding them, listening to them, and caring about them. That means creating the most valuable content or product that you can, tracking and refining your methods, and never stopping learning. It’s about real <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2012/05/29/the-naked-marketing-guide-to-getting-dramatically-more-traffic-and-subscribers/">marketing</a>, not trickery. And it works every time.”</p>
<p>“Where do I go to do that?” asked Rube.</p>
<p>“Well, there are a few good places, and in time you should visit them all,” he said. “I suggest learning about <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2006/02/14/blogging-for-beginners-2/">blogging</a>, especially <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2012/05/12/what-makes-good-content-marketing-great/">content marketing</a>, then perhaps <a href="http://www.problogger.net/using-social-media-sites-to-grow-your-blogs-traffic/">social media</a>, how <a href="http://www.problogger.net/search-engine-optimization-tips-for-bloggers/">search engines</a> work, and <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2010/08/20/how-well-do-your-blog-posts-score-out-of-100/">copywriting</a>, for starters.”</p>
<p>“But wouldn’t these whizz-bang doohickeys be faster and easier?” asked Rube.</p>
<p>“If they actually worked, they might be,” the old man said. “If they added value instead of noise, they might be. If they solved problems for people instead of gaming the system, they might be. If they provided lasting value instead of temporary gimmicks, they might be. Now, suppose you bought one, and that it worked for a while and then stopped; how would you fix it?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” replied Rube.</p>
<p>“That’s right. You wouldn’t know how to fix it. And if it didn’t work to start with, you wouldn’t know why. So you would be depending entirely on something you don’t understand, that may be of dubious construction and quality. Does that sound like a good business model?”</p>
<p>“Well, no,” said Rube, “of course not.”</p>
<p>“Right,” said the old man. “You’ve got to learn to earn. You got to give to get. That’s the way of the world. The Internet is no different.”</p>
<p>“Okay, I’ll give it a try!” said Rube.</p>
<p>“You do that,” the old man said. “And remember what you learned on the farm—prepare the soil, plant the seeds, tend the crops, and be patient. You can only reap what you sow, you know.”</p>
<p>Rube stood up to leave. “Thank you. Anything else I should keep in mind?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” the old man said, and handed Rube a tattered card. It read:</p>
<ul>
<li>If it sounds too good to be true, <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2009/07/09/why-automated-blogging-tools-should-be-avoided/">it’s probably not true</a>.</li>
<li>If it’s advertised as a “trick” or a “secret,” it’s probably a scam, or a loophole that will <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2011/07/15/getting-un-panda-lized-one-blogs-response-to-the-google-panda-update/">evaporate sooner or later</a>, if it even works at all.</li>
<li>People on the Internet don’t read; <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2012/04/28/how-to-write-a-great-paragraph/">they search and skim</a>; you have to <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2011/06/01/how-to-format-blog-posts-effectively/">capture and hold their attention</a>.</li>
<li>Always add value, and then <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2008/05/25/write-reviews-that-add-value-and-solve-readers-problems/">add even more</a>.</li>

</ul>
<p>Rube put the card in his pocket, and found he was once again alone on the road to the Big City. But now he <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2009/01/25/crawl-before-you-walk-6-step-by-step-instructions-for-starting-your-first-blog/">walked on</a> with a confident smile.</p>

<p>Admit it: you think I’m nuts. There’s no way a new blogger can write a viral blog post with five simple steps!</p>
<p>Well, as the saying goes: “I said it was simple, but it ain’t easy.” In fact, it will take a lot of work, but it can be done.</p>
<h2>The myth of the viral post</h2>
<p>There isn’t a blogger alive who hasn’t dreamed of writing that perfect blog post that will be read by thousands of people.</p>
<p>You spend time researching a trending topic.  You relentlessly pursue the perfect headline.  And you pour your heart into creating <a href="http://thinktraffic.net/write-epic-shit">epic content</a>.</p>
<p>Raise your hand if you’ve done this and have not created a viral blog post.</p>
<p>Writing about a trending topic, creating a perfect headline, and writing epic content are vital to having a post that goes viral.</p>
<p>But you are missing one thing: relationships.</p>
<p>In order for a post to go viral, it needs to be seen by the right people.</p>
<h2>What is a viral post?</h2>
<p>Before we get into how to build these relationships, I want to first share with you my definition of a viral post.</p>
<p>Math geeks will tell you that a post goes viral when the viral coefficient is greater than one.</p>
<p>But for the rest of us, a viral post for a new blogger is when one of your posts gets read and shared exponentially more than the others.  It’s as simple as that.</p>
<p>Below are the steps you can use to create a viral blog post.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Find a topic</h2>
<p>There are two key ingredients that make a successful topic. </p>
<p>First, the topic should be one that’s trending.  If you are a blogger, there is almost no chance that a “Twitter” topic will be successful.  It’s been done. However, the topic Pinterest will generate more interest. It’s a new social media company, and bloggers and marketers are still trying to figure out ways to leverage it.</p>
<p>To find a trending topic, read blogs in your niche and take note of which topics are getting the most comments, shares, and links.This will give you a good indication of what your audience wants to read and share with their social media following.</p>
<p>The second ingredient to a successful topic is the ability to write five unique posts on the topic.</p>
<p>For instance, you might write one post called “3 Steps to Drive Traffic with Pintrest,” and another post called “10 Companies Profiting from Pintrest.” But make sure you can write five posts, each taking a different angle on the topic you&#8217;ve chosen.</p>
<h2>Step 2: Find four blogs to submit guest posts to</h2>
<p>Once you have your topic, find four blogs to submit guest posts to.</p>
<p>ProBlogger has <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2012/02/10/6-powerful-guest-post-tactics-that-no-ones-talking-about/">a lot of advice</a> on <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2011/12/30/a-quick-and-dirty-guide-to-your-first-guest-post/">successfully submitting guest posts</a> <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2009/02/01/how-to-guest-post-to-promote-your-blog/">to popular blogs</a>.</p>
<p>For this process to work correctly, ensure that the blogs you are submitting your guest posts to have large Twitter followings.</p>
<h2>Step 3: Time your posts</h2>
<p>The most effective way to guest post is to write multiple posts that go live around the same time.  That will give your audience the impression that <a href="http://writelikefreddy.com/site/">you are everywhere</a>.</p>
<p>To do this correctly, prepare to schedule your posts to go live in about 60 days&#8217; time. Some of the more popular blogs receive a lot of submissions and have a large queue of posts they have to publish before they get to yours. But as long as you plan ahead, most bloggers and content managers will work with you to publish your post on the day you request.</p>
<h2>Step 4:  Publish a post on your own blog</h2>
<p>By now, you have written five blog posts and four have gone live on popular blogs. That leaves one post for you to publish on your own blog.</p>
<p>Publish this post two or three days after your final guest post has gone live.</p>
<h2>Step 5: Email bloggers</h2>
<p>Before you email the bloggers you’ve submitted guest posts to, check to see how well your post did relative to those around it. If it got a comparable number of shares, comments, and links, then you&#8217;re good to go.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the exact message that I write to bloggers.</p>
<p><em>Hey (Popular blogger),</p>
<p>I wanted to let you know that I created a follow up post to the one that went live on (date the post went live) that I think your readers will enjoy.</p>
<p>Pinterest is a hot topic these days and I couldn’t possibly provide all of the information in one post. I would love to know what you think.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Greg</em></p>
<p>The goal here is to get the bloggers to tweet your post, but you&#8217;ll notice that in this email I didn’t ask for the tweet. There is a chance that the post won’t resonate with the blogger&#8217;s audience. If that’s the case, you don’t want to ruin the relationship and ask for a commitment they are not willing to fulfill.</p>
<h2>The bottom line</h2>
<p>The truth is you might have to guest post two or three times on a blog in order to build the kind of relationship you&#8217;ll need to have that popular blogger tweet your link.</p>
<p>And if even you follow this process, there&#8217;s no way to guarantee that the post will go viral. However, getting your content seen by top influencers does give you a fighting chance.</p>
<p>Like I said, it is a simple five step process, but it’s not easy to execute.</p>
<p>Most of you are going to read this post, file it away somewhere and go about your business.  And that’s fine. I do that all the time. But there are a few of you who know deep down that your content deserves to get read on a consistent basis.</p>
<p>You know that your content is as good as, if not better than, the influencers in your niche. You just need your big break. Do yourself a favor.  Stop waiting for someone to hand you your break, and go grab it.</p>
<p>The world needs to hear what you have to say. So, what are you waiting for? Get your content seen.  Like right now!</p>

<p>I started iPhoneAppCafe.com back in 2010 with the aim of making it a profitable blog—a goal that I eventually achieved. However, after my first blogging venture, one thing became clear to me: writing is not actually my greatest strength.</p>
<p>I have always had lots of ideas and I recognize a good article when I see it. But when it comes to actually writing one, it often takes me far too long, and time is something that I can’t really spare because of my day job and other commitments.</p>
<p>So, here was my challenge: how could I approach the blog with a more businesslike attitude and employ the right team to help with the content?</p>
<p>That’s when it occurred to me that I could start a multi-writer blog.</p>
<p>If I focused on what I was good at, which is the design, development, and optimization of the blog (I manage ecommerce projects for a day job), then all I had to do was find writers who would write about what they are passionate about. They wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about the other boring jobs that go along with creating a successful site, such as how to setup a blog, publish content and promote it, and so on.</p>
<p>In 2010, the iPhone was still fairly new and everybody was talking about apps, with hundreds of new ones filling up the App Store every month. There wasn’t too much competition from the likes of Android to worry about either! iPhoneAppCafe’s promise was to share each app’s experience and help iPhone users discover great new apps.</p>
<h2>How did I get writers for my blog?</h2>
<p>This bit was pretty simple: I placed a number of ads on a local classified website and also on the <a href="http://jobs.problogger.net/">ProBlogger job board</a>. To my delight, what I found was that there are many iPhone enthusiasts who would happily rate and review their favourite apps for next to nothing. I even managed to get a number of people to write for free!</p>
<p>In addition to the standard app reviews, I also came up with ideas for a number of good top-10 lists and delegated the writing to the most suitable contributors.  Some of the lists got shared on social media and did really well in terms of traffic; even today, some of the best ones still get top ranking in Google and generate lots of traffic.</p>
<h2>5 keys to a successful multi-writer blog</h2>
<p>Hiring authors is the first step, but there are five key elements you&#8217;ll need to work on if your multi-author blog is to be a success.</p>
<h3>1. A popular subject</h3>
<p>Blogging about a topically popular subject will enable you to find passionate writers. In my case iPhone and apps were very popular at the time I launched the blog and still continue to be topical and talked about.</p>
<h3>2. An appealing job ad</h3>
<p>Create an appealing ad and communicate your vision in a way that involves and includes your contributors. Here are two of the ads I used.</p>
<p><em><strong>Get Free iPhone Apps By Writing For iPhoneAppCafe</strong></p>
<p>If you love your iPhone and enjoy reviewing apps, then why not apply to join our team of contributors?  You will receive promotional codes for free apps and get the opportunity for your reviews to be featured on one of the foremost iPhone app websites on the Internet!</p>
<p>To apply, simply send us a short (200-300 word) review of any iPhone app, along with a star ranking, the name of the developer, the latest release date, the price and an image caption, (all of which are available from the iTunes store) and a picture or screen shot of the app.  Those who get through will join the iPhoneAppCafe team and will receive free apps, a showcase for their writing and the opportunity to advance to paid article writing!</p>
<p><strong>Get Paid For Writing About Apps You Love</strong></p>
<p>Do you have a certain passion in life?  Can you write enthusiastically about that passion?  Could you use some extra pocket money?  Most importantly, do you have an iPhone?!</p>
<p>If the answer to all of these questions is yes, then we want to hear from you!  There are a few openings in the team at iPhoneAppCafe.com for talented writers who can write reviews of apps that are relevant to what they love.  For example, if you are a teacher then you could write about apps that help educate children; if you are a whiz in the kitchen, then you may want to write about cooking apps.</p>
<p>We are looking for contributors from different walks of life, in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sports people</li>
<li>Health and fitness enthusiasts</li>
<li>Food critics</li>
<li>Photographers</li>
<li>Entrepreneurs</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are interested in earning money to write about what you love, then simply send us a short (200-300 word) review of one of your favourite iPhone app, along with a star ranking and a picture or screen shot of the app.  Those who get through will join the iPhoneAppCafe team and will receive free apps to review, a showcase for your writing skills and, best of all, you’ll get paid £10-£15 to write top 5 and top 10 lists!</em></p>
<h3>3. Create author profiles</h3>
<p>Allow each contributor to have a profile containing their contact details. This will encourage graduates and those just starting out to write for free for you in the interest of building up their profiles and CVs. We have had writers who wrote for free and used their profile on our blog to get writing jobs in the tech industry.</p>
<h3>4. Select a topic that benefits from multiple viewpoints</h3>
<p>As an example, I had a musician writing about his favorite music apps, and a keen globetrotter writing about good travel apps. This goes hand in hand with our blog’s community aspect and the sharing of mutual and individual experiences.</p>
<h3>5. Share behind-the-scenes info</h3>
<p>Keep your writers engaged by sharing website statistics and traffic figures with them. You can also create traffic-related incentives—something that I experimented with, which gave mixed results. </p>
<p>There were certainly times when I felt the traffic-related bonuses motivated the writers to spend more time in sharing and bookmarking the articles.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s your story?</h2>
<p>These are the basic strategies I&#8217;ve used to build a successful blog without writing a word. What&#8217;s your story? Do you run a multi-author blog—or write for one? Share your experiences and tips with us.</p>

<p>Social media has proven its worth as a networking tool and a means of raising brand awareness, but the future of sites like Facebook and Twitter depend on convincing brands that that it’s worthwhile to <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB10001424052970204571404577255532594364766-lMyQjAxMTAyMDAwMTEwNDEyWj.html">invest in advertising on their sites</a> in addition to interacting with customers. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/ads/" target="_blank">Ads on Facebook</a> usually appear in the right column, though Facebook has been experimenting with more socially-based ads that show up in the streams of users. With its simpler interface, Twitter <a href="https://business.twitter.com/advertise/start/" target="_blank">relies on promoting tweets </a> that show up in the tops of users’ update streams.</p>
<p>No one has any doubts about the value of social media marketing through engaging customers, running promotions, and creating company pages. The majority of doubts surround the ROI and overall value of paying to advertise on social networks.</p>
<p>Many brands are still <a href="http://www.webpronews.com/social-media-overtakes-search-in-advertising-2012-05" target="_blank">engaged in social media advertising</a>, and the data available changes from year to year. However, for bloggers, it can be difficult to decide whether social media advertising is worth it.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the current advantages and disadvantages of using social media sites for your advertising campaigns.</p>
<h2>Advantages of social media advertising</h2>
<h3>Social helps campaigns go viral</h3>
<p>According to <a href="http://performancing.com/the-benefits-and-downfalls-of-using-social-media-advertising/" target="_blank">Kelsey Jones</a> of <a href="http://thesocialrobot.com/">the Social Robot</a>, “Companies and organizations can experience a large swell of website visitors, new customers, or Facebook fans all within a single day, depending on the effectiveness of their ads. This type of viral activity can be great for events and product launches.”</p>
<h3>Brands are satisfied with the level of engagement</h3>
<p>There’s no doubt that the right campaign can make a huge difference in driving visitors to a website. This <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-03-01/twitter-the-startup-that-wouldnt-die" target="_blank">spike in traffic for some major brands</a> makes social media advertising worth considering.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB10001424052970204571404577255532594364766-lMyQjAxMTAyMDAwMTEwNDEyWj.html" target="_blank"><em>Wall Street Journal</em> reports</a> that “Companies that have bought Twitter ads generally say they are happy with the percentage of people who click on their ads or circulate them to other Twitter users. But marketers also say these ads haven’t proven they can convert people into paying customers.”</p>
<h2>Disadvantages of social media advertising</h2>
<h3>The cost for national advertising campaigns is prohibitive</h3>
<p>Kelsey Jones <a href="http://performancing.com/the-benefits-and-downfalls-of-using-social-media-advertising/" target="_blank">writes at Performancing</a>, “For some targeted campaigns, competition can be very high, leading to high rates for clicks on social media ads or sponsored tweet impressions (views). For certain industries, the cost to run a viral campaign of this magnitude can be significant, up to thousands of dollars per day.”</p>
<p>While the cost of social media advertising can be quite steep for national campaigns, running an effective social media campaign through a free account on social media can produce similar results if managed properly. The opportunity to engage users through a free account may make it hard to justify the cost of Facebook or Twitter ads.</p>
<h3>Social advertising can be perceived negatively</h3>
<p>Unlike ads in magazines or on television, ads on social networks may prove to be ineffective or even a liability for brands, as customers may view them as an unwelcome intrusion.</p>
<p>One <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-17/f-commerce-trips-as-gap-to-penney-shut-facebook-stores-retail.html" target="_blank">Forrester analyst mentioned to Bloomberg</a> that injecting ads into a social platform is like interrupting a conversation among friends in order to attempt a sales pitch.</p>
<p>In fact, ads on a social network may be perceived as completely counter to what users are trying to accomplish. Some suggest that the success of social advertising hinges on whether brands can <a href="http://cdixon.org/2009/09/27/online-advertising-is-all-about-purchasing-intent/" target="_blank">identify the purchasing intent of users</a> and find the perfect point to introduce an ad into their social experience.</p>
<h3>The ROI is difficult to measure on social media</h3>
<p>Sean Jackson, the CFO of CopyBlogger, suggests that for all of the talk about being unable to measure the ROI of social media marketing in general, businesses should not be dismayed. <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/social-media-marketing-roi/" target="_blank">Jackson says</a>, “An investment is an asset that you purchase and place on your Balance Sheet. Like an office building or a computer system. It’s something you could sell later if you didn’t need it any more. Marketing is an expense, and goes on the Profit and Loss statement.”</p>
<p>Whether or not you agree with Jackson’s statement, the constant challenge of all marketing efforts over the years has been determining their ROI.</p>
<h2>Is it worth it?</h2>
<p>Social media advertising will undoubtedly produce greater brand awareness and user engagement with your brand, but the real risk is that brands may need to designate significant funds to their marketing efforts without necessarily receiving a guarantee that they’ll work. </p>
<p>That is a significant risk to take, but as brands seek to reach customers, we’ll see ongoing innovation among advertisers on social media platforms.</p>

<p>The current hot topic in the search engine optimization world is Google’s recent Penguin update—a move the search giant claims is intended to help reduce the presence of over-optimized web pages in the natural search results.</p>
<p>In fact, the possibility of a forthcoming over-optimization penalty was alluded to as early as this year’s SXSW festival in March, where Google spokesperson Matt Cutts made the <a href="http://searchengineland.com/too-much-seo-google%E2%80%99s-working-on-an-%E2%80%9Cover-optimization%E2%80%9D-penalty-for-that-115627">comment</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“[T]he idea is basically to try and level the playing ground a little bit. So all those people who have sort of been doing, for lack of a better word, “over optimization” or “overly” doing their SEO, compared to the people who are just making great content and trying to make a fantastic site, we want to sort of make that playing field a little bit more level.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, that “level playing ground” is here with the April 24<sup>th</sup> release of the Penguin algorithm update, which has affected an estimated <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-launches-update-targeting-webspam-in-search-results-119295">3% of all search queries</a>. If you saw your blog traffic dip unexpectedly on this date, it’s possible you’ve been “pecked” by the Google Penguin—an indication that your blog is considered to be over-optimized in the eyes of the search giant.</p>
<p>Of course, knowing that you’ve been affected and taking remedial actions to recover from a Penguin penalty are two different things. Because of Google’s natural reticence when it comes to revealing the exact parameters that cause a site to be flagged for over-optimization, it’s impossible to know exactly which factors led to your site’s penalty.</p>
<p>The key to determining how to move forward following a Penguin attack lies in identifying potential over-optimization flags that can be quantified and measured by the search engines.  Remember, the Googlebot can’t manually assess the quality of every website online. Instead, it must rely on measurable signals that can be used to infer objective value.</p>
<p>Based on these criteria, there are a few possible areas that every post-Penguin recovery plan should address:</p>
<h2>On-site over-optimization</h2>
<p>The first potential avenue through which Google could quantify metrics and assess over-optimization penalties is through the abuse of well-known on-page SEO best practices.  The following are a few of the specific indicators you’ll want to pay attention to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Title tags:</strong> Because your pages’ title tags play a big role in your on-site SEO, this keyword stuffing opportunity has long been abused by web spammers.  If you’ve ever seen a title tag that reads something like, “Lose weight, fast weight loss, lose weight now with these tips,” you’ve seen an example of on-site over-optimization that could easily be detected and penalized by the search engines.</p>
<p>Instead, a far better solution is to structure your title tags as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incorporate your target keyword only once, in a way that sounds natural and accurately describes the content of your page.</li>
<li>Add your brand’s name to your title tags, as there’s some indication that Google is giving increased weight to websites with established brands.</li>
<li>Limit your title tags to 60-70 characters for maximum search engine consideration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Internal links:</strong> Another on-site website element that’s easily manipulated from an SEO standpoint is its internal link structure. “PageRank sculpting” or “link sculpting” devotees claim that by manipulating the anchor text distribution and flow of Google PageRank from one blog post to another, they can control how each page on their site is valued by the search engines.</p>
<p>Well, guess what?  Because the search engine spiders navigate the web using links, they’ve gotten pretty good at understanding what natural internal link distribution looks like—as well as what it looks like when bloggers and other webmasters build internal links in an intentionally manipulative fashion!</p>
<p>For best results, link to other pages using internal links only when it makes sense for your readers.  Build your site’s navigation structure and architecture in a way that helps visitors access different areas of your site effectively, and add links between blog posts only when the information is relevant and provides value for your readers.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Footer links:</strong> This on-site over-optimization element is so obviously detectable by the search engines that it’s not even funny! I’ll keep this one brief: don’t pack the footer section of your blog full of unnecessary links for the sole purpose of manipulating anchor text, link relevance or internal PageRank flow.  Seriously, just don’t do it!</li>
<li><strong>Scraped or stuffed content:</strong> Again, manipulated content is an over-optimization red flag that should be an obvious “no go,” yet it’s amazing how many websites still make use of content that’s either copied and pasted from other sites or so packed full of keywords that it’s nearly illegible to human readers.</p>
<p>If you have either of these two types of content on your blog, get them off as soon as possible!  While scraped and stuffed content may have helped your site to rank well in the natural search results pages in the past, it’s an obvious red flag to a search engine that’s indicated its desire to go after web spammers.  Even if your site survived the Penguin update unscathed, chances are you won’t be so safe in the future!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Off-site over-optimization</h2>
<p>In addition to the specific optimization activities you undertake on your website, your off-site actions can be treated as red flags by the Penguin penalty and future updates as well.  Here are a few of the specific elements you’ll want to pay attention to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Link velocity:</strong> Although having external links pointing back at your site is an important part of optimizing your website effectively for the search engines, the rate at which you acquire these links (a.k.a. your “link velocity”) should be treated with the utmost caution.</p>
<p>Ideally, your blog’s backlink profile should look as natural as possible—even if you’re following SEO backlinking best practices. If your blog is well-established and well-regarded within your industry, it may be able to handle receiving dozens of new backlinks a day.  On the other hand, if your site is new, you can bet the search engines realize that it doesn’t look natural to have a young site earning handfuls of new links every day!</p>
<p>Although there’s no hard and fast rule about how many links are too many links, it’s best to focus on obtaining a few high-value backlinks than to spam your site with dozens or hundreds of low quality links.  Be especially cautious in the few six months of your site’s life, and hold off on any major link building campaigns until your site is indexed appropriately by the search engines.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Anchor text distribution:</strong> As you undertake your link building campaigns, steer clear of the dated advice to incorporate only your target keyword and a few closely related variations as anchor text within your new links.  Google Penguin has changed the way anchor text is valued, so having too high of a concentration of exact match anchor text backlinks could set your site up for future penalties.</p>
<p>In addition, if you’ve used targeted anchor text links in the past, it might be worthwhile to remove as many as possible or to dilute their strength with untargeted links.  For more information on how to evaluate your existing link building profile for anchor text distribution, check out SEOMoz’s article titled, <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/how-to-survive-googles-unnatural-links-warnings-avoid-overoptimisation">How to Survive Google’s Unnatural Links Warnings &amp; Avoid Over-Optimisation</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Sitewide links:</strong> One final indicator of over-optimization you’ll want to be aware of is a high density of “sitewide links.”</p>
<p>Sitewide links are those that appear in areas of a website that are displayed on every single page of that site—for example, in the sidebar or footer area of a blog.  Because these types of links can be used to quickly increase the number of backlinks pointing at a blog for the sole purpose of manipulating the search results, they’re an easy target for Google Penguin and similar future updates.</p>
<p>To find instances of sitewide links, use the “Links to your site” feature found in Google’s Webmaster Tools or other paid link research programs like Ahrefs or the Open Site Explorer.  Then, as you encounter instances of sitewide links, you can either request their removal from the offending sites or increase your other link building activities in order to diminish their impact on your site.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>We&#8217;re always told in life that we should distinguish between those things we &#8220;want&#8221; and those things we &#8220;need.&#8221; The general idea of this is that we need to prioritise the things we do and things we buy according to their necessity. </p>
<p>Generally speaking, this is a pretty sound piece of advice—it ensures we don&#8217;t end up sitting on a mountain of chocolate when we have no toilet paper, for example. It ensures we have a roof over our heads before we go out and buy a two-seater soft-top. It ensures we don&#8217;t head off on our holidays before we&#8217;ve turned off all the lights, switched off the fridge, and put the cats in the cattery.</p>
<p>But I think I&#8217;ve found a flaw in this sound advice. I think that sometimes you have to put the &#8220;wants&#8221; up front. Sometimes, doing something because you need to do it, or buying something because you need to buy it, kind of takes the sparkle out of whatever that thing is. It makes the doing or the purchasing of that thing into a chore. And nobody likes chores.</p>
<p>I’m an extra-curricular blogger. I work full-time hours (sometimes more) and have several out-of-work commitments aside from my blog, as do many of you. At some point in time, I set myself a mental target to write two blog posts a week, minimum. It’s an amount that kept my blog looking up-to-date when people stumbled across it, it ensured my readers didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d fallen off the face of the planet, and it made me feel that I was not wasting all the efforts I&#8217;d put into building up the small web presence I have.</p>
<p>Setting myself that target was, in many ways, a big error. It made every blog post I did into a &#8220;need.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>&#8220;I need to write a blog post tonight; I haven&#8217;t posted anything since last Friday&#8221;</em> was a phrase my partner heard with alarming regularity.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I wrote a post and made a promise to my readers that I would be featuring a certain something the week after. Most of the time, when I made that promise, the &#8220;certain something&#8221; wasn&#8217;t even written yet. So then I needed to write it, because I said I would. </p>
<p>Mass panic ensued when, five days later, that post still hadn&#8217;t been written. So I would write it one night after work, when I was tired, fed-up, hungry, distracted, and my brain had all but turned to mush. I can&#8217;t imagine that writing in this state showcased the best of my abilities.</p>
<p>Sound familiar? Perhaps it&#8217;s time to make a change.</p>
<h2>Changing the &#8220;needs&#8221; into &#8220;wants&#8221;</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult to try and juggle life with blogging, especially with other commitments taking up our time, such as full-time jobs or children. It can be easy to lose track of the reason we started writing in the first place and we can begin to view updating our blogs as a chore. </p>
<p>This is how I felt. For a while, I wallowed in pity and despair, complaining of lack of time and inspiration. Then I got a grip, and decided to actually do something constructive towards reclaiming my blogging pizzazz. </p>
<p>I mined the internet and other blogs looking for inspiration and advice, and have collated my tried and tested favourites here for you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Write a blog manifesto:</strong> Sometimes we need a reminder of what our blog is all about, and why we started it in the first place. It can help to focus us when we deviate from the intended path, and provide inspiration when our brains are flagging. Write a business plan for your blog. Done properly, it will help you recapture all it is that you love about your blog, and fill you with enthusiasm on every read.</li>
<li><strong>Give yourself designated blogging time:</strong> Most extra-curricular activities take place at designated times. Your pilates class may run from 7-8pm on a Wednesday, for example. You would be frowned upon if you took the kids and dog along with you, and you wouldn&#8217;t break away to sort out the washing half way through. Why should your blog be any different? Give your blog some respect, and set aside some designated &#8220;blog time.&#8221; Even if just for an hour a week, it could be the boost your writing needs.</li>
<li><strong>Keep a notebook:</strong> If you don&#8217;t do this already, this is the one thing you really must try. If, like me, you can&#8217;t just leap onto a computer and type away whenever inspiration strikes, then please, please, <em>please</em> carry a notebook. Superglue it to your torso if you have to. And for goodness sake, don’t forget a pen. Whenever you have a light-bulb idea, you can scribble it down, and whenever you find yourself with a spare ten minutes, you can do a bit of blog scheduling. Then, when you&#8217;re staring gormlessly at your screen without a scrap of inspiration, you can delve into your notebook and pull out a gem of a post.</li>
<li><strong>Stop worrying:</strong> Yes, social media is important. Yes, regular content on your blog is important. No, it isn&#8217;t so important that you should panic about it. Posting ill-thought-out content on your blog or your social media sites just so there&#8217;s something there could be just as damaging as not saying anything at all. So don&#8217;t sweat it.</li>
<li><strong>Re-evaluate the depth and length of your posts:</strong> If you find that you are never able to finish writing a post in the time you have set aside, perhaps you really need to consider altering the length of your posts. I personally have this problem. I waffle. A lot. By capping the length of my posts I feel much more gratified by my writing, as now I can actually write whole posts in one sitting!</li>
<li><strong>Lose the day job:</strong> An extreme solution? Perhaps, but if your blog is generating interest that you just can&#8217;t keep up with, and you can see potential for making revenue if <em>only</em> you had time to set up that affliate marketing scheme/write that sponsored post/put some ad spaces on your homepage, then maybe you should seriously look at whether you can make your blog more than just a hobby. Talk to your boss: they may be able to reduce your hours or offer more flexible working patterns. If you&#8217;re unsure of how things will turn out, look into career break options or extended holiday to trial the pro blogger life.</li>

<p>If you look at the response from his readers, you&#8217;ll note the sense of excitement that this post generated. Words like love, awesome, absolutely amazing, and cool come up again and again in the comments. Readers are bookmarking the list and immediately (it seems) going to check out the recommended sites.</p>
<p>Resource lists like this really are valuable for readers. But if you&#8217;re putting together a resource list, you&#8217;ll want to think hard about how you do it. To my mind, there are five key factors that make or break a resource list.</p>
<h2>1. Size</h2>
<p>This post is a whopper—100 resources is a <em>lot</em>. It does make the list epic, and link-worthy, but it also works because the links aren&#8217;t time-limited. These resources will be as good in eight months as they are today, so readers can bookmark the list and come back to it again and again.</p>
<p>A list of 100 daily deals, for example, is probably less bookmarkable, since it&#8217;ll be useless by tomorrow. In deciding on a length for your resource list, look at the longevity of the content as well as its sharability. The greater the longevity of your resource, the more repeat traffic it&#8217;ll generate from those who do bookmark it.</p>
<h2>2. Quality</h2>
<p>At the beginning of the post, Tom explains that the list is &#8220;a labor of love&#8221;. Your resource list should reflect the same degree of care for your readers.</p>
<p>Many lists are put together simply for the sake of links, but they&#8217;ll gain fewer initial links—and less repeat visits—if the quality isn&#8217;t up to scratch. I often find the best resource lists are those that list &#8220;plugins that have saved my site&#8221; or &#8220;sites that helped me make my first online paycheque&#8221;—tools and services that the author has used herself, and can speak intelligently on.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t just jam well-regarded resources together into a post. If you can give your own personal take on the resources you&#8217;re listing, your readers will relate, and appreciate the list all the more.</p>
<h2>3. Layout</h2>
<p>Tom&#8217;s presented his list in an easy-to-use, completely sortable table. This makes it really easy for readers to use the content, and undoubtedly encourages readers to use the post more than if he&#8217;d just provided an unsortable bullet list.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the little things like this that really make your resource extra-valuable for readers. Think about the usability of your list, from the perspective of your readers, as you&#8217;re preparing it for publication.</p>
<h2>4. Extras</h2>
<p>You&#8217;ll notice that Tom asks readers to mention any other sites they feel he should have added. This tactic helps to make the resource even more valuable. Once dedicated readers have checked out every link in the table, they can start scouring the comments for good resources that didn&#8217;t make the cut.</p>
<p>This technique also ensures Tom has additional resources to consider for next year, gives him insight into the other information his readers access and value on a regular basis, and may help him to shape things like his content strategy or brand position going forward. Asking readers to contribute their own links is a great way to provide—and gain—extra value from your resource post.</p>
<h2>5. Iteration</h2>
<p>This post is a repeat of a resource list that was compiled almost six months before. This is a great advantage to these kinds of posts—especially if they&#8217;re as epic as Tom&#8217;s list.</p>
<p>We do the same thing with Jade Craven&#8217;s <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2011/12/31/20-bloggers-to-watch-in-2012/">Bloggers to Watch</a> posts, which she compiles every year for ProBlogger. Run your updated resource post regularly—at an appropriate interval—and your readers will likely refer to the previous ones as well as bookmarking the most recent one. They may even come to look forward to your new resource post each quarter, six months, or year.</p>
<p>Have you created resource posts for your blog&#8217;s readers? What&#8217;s worked for you—and what hasn&#8217;t? Add tips from your own experience in the comments—we&#8217;d love to learn how you make resource posts work.</p>

<p>Let’s face it: updating your blog on a daily basis doesn’t necessarily make you smart. It might be helpful, but there is more to blogging than writing. </p>
<p>How about doing this online &#8220;thing&#8221; as if it&#8217;s a real business? A brick and mortar business? </p>
<p>I strongly believe you could turn a profit easily if you change your mindset and style.</p>
<p>Of course, you’ll continuously write quality content—after all, that’s what your readers need. But turning your blog into a real-life business would help you connect, share, and breathe life into your blog.</p>
<p>It’s about productivity that leads to profit.</p>
<h2>You need confidence to win</h2>
<p>There are good reasons why you need confidence in your business. Confidence electrifies you and your readers, and prompts action. Entrepreneurs are risk-takers, yet many bloggers may decide to hang on to outdated principles instead of challenging the status quo.</p>
<p>But we can change that.</p>
<p>With all the noise in the blogosphere, it takes extra wit to attract targeted readers and build a tribe. Without confidence, you won’t be able to organize and manage your business.</p>
<p>You need to challenge yourself to take responsibility.</p>
<p>If you want to build a profitable blog, you must run it like an offline business. You need to master:</p>
<ul>
<li>organization and management</li>
<li>customer service</li>
<li>social etiquette</li>
<li>profit</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are the four essential factors in building a successful offline business—but they&#8217;re extremely beneficial to blogging, too. Are you ready to explore?</p>
<h2>1. Organization and management</h2>
<blockquote><p>Jesus picked up twelve men from the bottom ranks of business and forged them into an organization that conquered the world.—Bruce Barton</p></blockquote>
<p>“How do I get more people to trust me?” many bloggers ask.</p>
<p>Trust isn’t a one-off decision. You need to be consistent and build trust over time. As you interact with the target audience and provide valuable information, your readers will start to take your words to heart.</p>
<p>That is why you need to organize and manage your blog. A well organized and managed blog will soon become the go-to resource for your target prospects and readers.</p>
<p>First, you need to organize and manage your time. Use your time wisely. Your blog attracts people who have needs. They want answers. Use the limited time at your disposal to focus on answering your readers’ questions, and outsource the other tasks to professionals.</p>
<p>The easiest and most lucrative way to stay organized is to outsource. Before I launched my first ebook, I didn’t understand outsourcing one bit. I had to do the entire task myself—market research, keyword research, cover design, writing, and marketing. As a result, my blog suffered, and my engagement with my audience was broken. I also observed a drop in daily traffic and comments.</p>
<p>Like offline businesses, on your blog, the management (that&#8217;s you) is responsible for delegation. Use outsourcing as a corporation uses its departments, and your blog will grow and produce better results. Identify your greatest strengths. Outsource the other tasks (find freelancers at <a href="https://www.odesk.com/">Odesk</a> and <a href="https://www.elance.com/">Elance</a>).</p>
<p>You don’t have to be a jack-of-all-trades to succeed online.</p>
<h2>2. Customer service</h2>
<p>We’re so used to customers in the offline business, but bloggers often don’t recognize who our customers are online.</p>
<p>Your readers are your customers, and how you treat them is important to your success.</p>
<p>It’s your responsibility to respect your readers and visitors. Address them by name and reply to their comments with the proper salutation. When someone comes to your site, they should feel that you care. They don’t have to be strangers—at least, not any more.</p>
<p>Create an environment of warmth with prospects and readers. When you give away valuable ebooks or software, or something that will make readers remember you, you’re building a solid relationship.When you send a quote to a prospect, send a gift, too. No matter how small it looks, it’ll create a bond between you and your target audience.</p>
<p>Also, your readers need to know what’s happening at your blog. If you’ll be making changes, you should notify them beforehand. Surprises are good, but not at the detriment of your business. And when there&#8217;s a complaint, accept it peacefully and with good humor. See your readers as your friends.</p>
<p>Good customer service can boost your online business and expose you to a world of opportunities.</p>
<h2>3. Social etiquette</h2>
<p>You can’t help it—you’ve achieved so much in life, and feel a bit fulfilled. Perhaps you have a slight tendency to brag when you blog. But is this healthy for your audience? I don’t think so.</p>
<p>Social etiquette is an attitude. It requires you to look at your personal life, and consider how you bring it to the table as a blogger. Those who don’t share, communicate, and help others have problems with their lives. The problem isn’t the blog or the business—it’s their personal life.</p>
<p>If you focus on helping people, there won’t be a room for bragging. Your level of blogging success today is directly proportional to the value you create. So change your approach and focus on readers, their problems, and how you can help.</p>
<p>That’s how you can use etiquette to make your blog a profitable business.</p>
<h2>4. Profit from your blog</h2>
<p>As your blog grows into a business and you build its uniqueness, you’ll begin to attract high-paying prospects and outstanding offers. Are you prepared for the opportunities your blogging business could create?</p>
<p>Blogging offers different opportunities to profit. When you visit my <a href="http://contentmarketingup.com/">content marketing blog</a>, you won’t find an affiliate banner or link. I sell my writing services and generate enough income to pay my bills. And guess what? I didn’t apply for any writing job; I was contacted directly by entrepreneurs because they discovered I was business-minded.</p>
<h3>Land a job</h3>
<p>Perhaps you&#8217;d like a secure, and well-paid job. If that’s the case, running your blog like a real business can be of help. I’ve worked with a human resource firm prior to running my online business. Employers were looking for hard working, passionate, confident go-getters who could help reach the organization&#8217;s goals.</p>
<p>Most bloggers don’t have these qualities. They see a blog as a tool, rather than the true business that it is. Are you confident to put your blog&#8217;s URL on your resume? If not, consider running it more like a business that you can be proud of.</p>
<p>You’ve seen blogs featured at CNN, Fox News, and so forth. Those are no half-baked blogs—they’re manned by savvy entrepreneurs. If they can do it, why shouldn&#8217;t you?</p>
<h3>Monetize your blog</h3>
<p>Most blogs have no product to sell, but they’re updated regularly. I once asked a blogger friend of mine, “Why don’t you monetize your blog?”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to chase my readers away,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>Who says selling chases readers away? Monetizing a blog is as important as setting up and updating the blog. Without this, people won’t take you seriously. You’ll be regarded as a newbie at worst, and an amateur at best.</p>
<h3>Sell a product</h3>
<p>Selling a product or offering a service via your blog won&#8217;t annoy readers, provided it’s valuable and offers practical solutions to their problems.</p>
<p>If you decide to monetize with affiliate offers, be honest in your reviews. Let readers know you’ll earn commissions when they buy via your affiliate link. This helps to build credibility and shows that you genuinely want to help them.</p>
<p>If you decide to create your own product, spend time with your audience so that you can understand what they need, and build a product that truly delivers.</p>
<p>Do you see your blog as a real business &#8230; or &#8220;just a blog&#8221;?  Is it time you changed your philosophy? Share your thoughts in the comments.</p>

<p>You don’t need me to tell you about Pinterest do you? I&#8217;m pretty sure you’ve heard all the media outlets singing its praise:</p>
<ul>
<li>the fastest growing site</li>
<li>its user base is mostly female</li>
<li>its breakthrough rise from obscurity</li>
<li>how marketers are using it</li>
<li>how marketers CAN use it</li>
<li>how its a step forward in the evolution of social media</li>
<li>&#8230;and etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Pinterest_Logo.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-22360" title="Pinterest Logo" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Pinterest_Logo-300x75.png" alt="Pinterest Logo" width="300" height="75" /></a>I mean we’ve talked about it <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2012/03/26/pinterest-basics-for-bloggers/">over here too</a>, haven’t we?</p>
<p>But what else can we as bloggers and businesspeople learn from this recent phenom? Namely:</p>
<h2>1. Have a greater purpose</h2>
<p>When CEO Ben Silbermann created Pinterest, he did so with the purpose of making something “timeless.” Like most great entrepreneurs, he created the company out of his own interests, passions, and purpose.</p>
<p>Throughout history, truly great companies answer these question: Who are we? And what are we about?</p>
<ul>
<li>Glen Allsop of Viperchill believes in an <a href="http://www.viperchill.com/self-employment-manual/">internal mission statement</a>.</li>
<li>Chris Guillebeau believes in a 140-character <a href="http://michaelhyatt.com/the-140-character-mission-statement.html">mission statement</a>.</li>
<li>Devin Hughes of Upstart Nation <a href="http://www.personalbrandingblog.com/what%e2%80%99s-your-mission-statement/">believes a personal mission statement</a> becomes a necessity in one’s personal brand portfolio.</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, purpose is the catalyst for all great companies and organizations.</p>
<p>When Steve Jobs came back to Apple he came back to a mess: little to no market share, declining revenue, and a business almost on the verge of bankruptcy. He turned the company around simply by focusing on what the company had long overlooked: <em>its core purpose</em>.</p>
<p>According to Jobs:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Apple was in serious trouble. Apple had to remember who Apple was because they’d forgotten who Apple was.”</p></blockquote>
<p>We all know how that ended up!</p>
<p>Companies like Wal-Mart, Southwest Airlines, Charles Schwab, and BMW are all purpose-driven. In fact, John Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods Market, repeatedly stresses the importance of companies having a core purpose. These entrepreneurs make money (in fact, they make a ton) but they set out to “change the world” in some way or other.</p>
<p>I know this sounds like some touchy-feely-cry-me-a-river-nonsense! I understand that.</p>
<p>But purpose is anything but nonsense. It&#8217;s a viable business strategy—an immutable law. And those companies, entrepreneurs, and bloggers that practice it always rise above the crowd!</p>
<h2>2. Have a great product</h2>
<p>Not an okay, good, or not-too-bad product. But a <em>great</em> product!</p>
<p>From the very few interviews there are with Silbermann, you can feel his obsession with the quality of the site:</p>
<ul>
<li>He and his team spent a lot of time agonizing over the site&#8217;s five-column layout, producing almost a dozen fully-coded versions before settling on the one that is live today.</li>
<li>According to him, he&#8217;d rather spend time working on the site than giving interviews. The site is <a href="http://under30ceo.com/pinterest-7-ways-being-an-addict-can-benefit-your-business/">incredibly addictive</a> because he obsessed over every detail.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the blogger, this boils down to <a href="http://thinktraffic.net/write-epic-shit">writing epic content</a> (thanks again, Corbett Barr!).</p>
<p>But maybe that’s not for you. I mean, you could just follow the crowd, make an okay product, and write ok content.</p>
<p>You <em>could</em> do that.  You won’t get <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2012/05/27/5-surefire-ways-to-never-get-noticed-by-anybody/">noticed</a> that way, but you could do it. It&#8217;s totally up to you!</p>
<h2>3. Forget the mainstream: go after those who want it!</h2>
<p><a href="http://petecashmore.com/">Pete Cashmore</a> <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2012-02-06/tech/tech_web_pinterest-website-cashmore_1_sites-social-networks-early-adopters?_s=PM:TECH">noted early on</a> that Pinterest didn&#8217;t take the mainstream route to success:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The web-based pinboard, which launched almost two years ago, barely got a mention on Silicon Valley news sites until six months ago, when early adopters suddenly realized that a site with millions of monthly users had sprung up almost unnoticed by the tech press. That&#8217;s because Pinterest didn&#8217;t take the usual route of Web-based startups: romancing early adopters and technology journalists before attempting to cross the chasm to mainstream adoption. Instead, Pinterest grew a devoted base of users—most of them female—who enjoy &#8216;pinning&#8217; items they find around the Web.”</p></blockquote>
<p>That was totally unheard of. And yet this strategy produced better results than a thousand press releases.</p>
<p>It was the strategy used by <a href="http://michaelgholmes.com/2010/11/24/3-srategies-early-hymn-writers-could-teach-breakthrough-startups/">early hymn writers</a>. While the majority of church attendees didn&#8217;t see the value of the songs, the hymn writers focused all their attention on those that did. Ultimately the majority came around.</p>
<p>It’s <a href="http://under30ceo.com/how-to-redsicover-the-lost-art-of-focus/">the strategy</a> used by great salespeople, startups, and game changers. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>When an unknown author named Tim Ferriss decided to promote his book, he focused his efforts. <a href="http://mixergy.com/tim-ferriss/">He called successful authors</a> and asked them how they promoted their books. They gave him two answers: radios and bloggers. Since radio was losing its influence he decided to rely on bloggers. He went to a blogger event, met the ones he wanted to meet, established relationships, and then asked them to do a review. They did. And with the book becoming the #1 <em>New York Times</em>, the #1 <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and the #1 <em>Businessweek</em> bestseller, the rest is history.</li>
<li>When Mel Gibson decided to market <em>The Passion of the Christ</em>, he focused his efforts. When he approached movie executives about producing the movie nobody wanted to go near it. So Gibson decided to fund it himself using $30 million of his own money. Not having much money left to marketing (it usually costs $40 million for marketing, he only had $15 million) he tried an unconventional approach: letting pastors see it for free.  They started small–showing only a few pastors, but it grew exponentially. One of the final screenings was at Willow Creek Church. After the showing, Bill Hybels took the stage and spoke for the 5,000 pastors in attendance: “All right, what do you need us to do?”  And with $611,899,420 in gross sales, the rest is history.</li>
<li>When a Baptist preacher named Rick Warren decided to market his book, <em>Purpose-Driven Life</em>, he focused his efforts. Years before he wrote his first book, Purpose Driven Church and followed it up with a website: Pastors.Com. The membership of the website grew to 85,000 pastors who saw Warren as trusted advisor. He enlisted their help with the PDL book–asking them to conduct the “40 day campaign” in their churches. <a href="http://www.inplainsite.org/html/purpose_driven_pyromarketing.html">And 1200 agreed to it</a>. He gave away copies of the $20 book for $7 to churches and congregations that agreed. Within two months, those spokespeople pushed sales to $2 million, then to 30 million copies by 2007 &#8230; and the rest is history.</li>
<li>When an pop artist by the name of Lady Gaga found success it was through focus. She did everything she could to <a href="http://under30ceo.com/the-5-mind-blowingly-simple-strategies-any-startup-can-learn-from-lady-gaga/">break through</a>: schmoozed the music execs, performed wherever she could, had doors slammed in her face, begged to have her music played on the radio, was cut from a label, and was told she wouldn’t make it. But the turning point for her was her acceptance by the gay community. Once they accepted her, they championed for her, and she championed for them. And the rest is history.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why do we spend the bulk of our time trying to get people who don’t like us to like? And in the meantime turn our backs to those that love us?</p>
<ul>
<li>Rick Warren didn’t market to atheists.</li>
<li>Mel Gibson only showed screenings to conservative Christian and religious groups (even refusing to include those that initially criticized the film).</li>
<li>Timothy Ferriss didn’t go after those interested in a nine-to-five lifestyle.</li>
<li>Not once did Lady Gaga try to win over those who adamantly opposed her. She focused all her attention on her “monsters.”</li>
</ul>
<p>It doesn’t make any sense does it?</p>
<p>Well, with 20 million users and a $1.5 billion valuation, it’s evident Silbermann understood the power of fans.</p>
<h2>4. Remember: service is the best form of marketing</h2>
<p>In the beginning, Silbermann said he personally wrote to the first 5,000 users, gave them his cell phone number, and even met many of them for coffee. He asked them questions, listened to their concerns, and went above and beyond for them.</p>
<p>Whoa!</p>
<p>Sometimes in the middle of our social media, SEO, and direct marketing efforts we forget that great service is still the best form of marketing.</p>
<p>There are six primary reasons people stop doing business with a company:</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>1% die.</li>
<li>3% move away.</li>
<li>5% develop other relationships.</li>
<li>9% leave for competitive reasons.</li>
<li>14% are dissatisfied with the product.</li>
<li>68% percent go elsewhere because of the poor way they were treated by employees of the company.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>Case in point: when Patton Gleason went live with his online startup, the Natural Running Store, he outhustled his competitors in terms of service:</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<ul>
<li>He created personalized videos that thanked customers for their purchase.</li>
<li>He created videos that told customers their shoes were on the way.</li>
<li>He put handwritten notes in the shoe boxes.</li>
<li>He sent follow-up emails asking about his or her training plans.</li>
<li>Instead of having an FAQ page, he sends out a two-minute video answering the customer’s questions.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/naturalrunning.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21793" title="naturalrunningstore.com" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/naturalrunning.png" alt="naturalrunningstore.com" width="505" height="351" /></a></p>
<p>Because of this, Natural Running Store receives a ton of organic traffic, customer referrals, and endless praise.</p>
<p>And this is with Gleason admitting he <a href="http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/social-service-allows-startup-to-outpace-the-competition/">doesn&#8217;t know how to sell</a>.</p>
<p>You’ve all heard the story of how the <a href="http://www.blogtyrant.com/how-i-sold-a-blog-for-20000-in-8-months/">Blog Tyrant became a true fan of Darren</a>? You didn’t? For shame! “What happened?” you ask. Well, I’ll just let the Tyrant tell you:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I once sent Darren Rowse an email telling him that I was having problems leaving a comment on his site. I told him not to worry about it too much as it was obviously working fine for everyone else. He replied in about ten minutes telling me that every single one of his readers were important to him and then tried to problem solve the issue with me. Instant fan for life.”</p></blockquote>
<p>My friends, we’ve entered a new paradigm: marketing is the <a href="http://www.ducttapemarketing.com/blog/2012/02/23/marketing-is-the-new-selling/">new selling</a> and relationship building, engagement, and delivering new and innovative content is the new marketing.</p>
<p>High five for Silbermann!</p>
<h2>What can we learn?</h2>
<p>Right now we don’t know what’s in store for Pinterest. Right now, they’re flying as high as a Facebook IPO. They’re on top right now.</p>
<p>But if history has been any kind of teacher we’ll find more lessons in their story as the days go on. Good or bad.</p>
<p>What do you think? Are there any other lessons we can learn from Pinterest, or other startups like them?</p>

<p>I also happen to run a six-figure blog and business called <em><a href="http://www.themiddlefingerproject.org/">The Middle Finger Project</a></em>.</p>
<p>As in <em>the bad finger</em>. The vulgar one. The one that angry New York drivers, hormone-laden teenagers and Roseanne Barr use regularly.</p>
<p>And, apparently, <em>me</em>. The overly polite one with the master&#8217;s degree who considers herself educated and knows when to use which stupid little fork when.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t attempt to explain this blaring contradiction, but what I will tell you is this: <em>success online comes with confidence accompanied by an opinion you&#8217;re willing to fight for, and having a business named like I do implies both.</em></p>
<p>Certainly those aren&#8217;t the only factors, but they&#8217;re two of the most important—you can try to be as “useful” as possible, as the standard advice goes, but if you&#8217;re lacking confidence—or an authoritative spine—<em>no one will care about you. </em></p>
<p>And if no one cares about you, you don&#8217;t have a blog—<em>or</em> a business.</p>
<p>Right there—there&#8217;s an opinion of mine. You can take it or leave it, but one thing&#8217;s for sure—you&#8217;re listening.</p>
<p>And really that&#8217;s the first step in building a successful blog that sells your consulting business—wrangling some attention. And then learning how to keep it. And then learning how to <em>leverage it.</em></p>
<p>The Middle Finger Project started as just that—a platform for attention. It wasn&#8217;t developed as a business first, and a blog later—the platform began as a blog, and quite deliberately. And the reason is because you need attention first and foremost: <em>if no one&#8217;s listening, no one&#8217;s buying</em>. Particularly in the online space.</p>
<p>I should know; I&#8217;ve tried both. In 2006 I opened my first copywriting business, sans blog. Blogging wasn&#8217;t even on my radar at the time, quite unfortunately, and that business quickly plummeted to a gory, bloody, bone-shattering demise. Closed-casket style.</p>
<p>It failed because no one knew about me.</p>
<p>But realistically, it failed because I didn&#8217;t <em>make</em> anyone know about me.</p>
<p>I had if-you-build-it-they-will-come syndrome, and I still see a lot of that around these days, too. It&#8217;s not intentional, of course, but we all get so excited about our businesses, and think the world will share our excitement as soon as we open our doors.</p>
<p>Little do we realize that we have to <em>give them a reason to get excited.</em> Just like hanging your swankiest panties out on the line won&#8217;t cause Prince Charming to show up at your door (trust me, I&#8217;ve tried), hanging your swankiest web design on the internet won&#8217;t cause your customers to magically show up, either.</p>
<h2>You&#8217;ve got to give &#8216;em a reason to care about you</h2>
<p>Blogs help that process along. Blogs give you a way to make that happen. Blogs give you a chance to prove yourself. And blogs give you a chance to snag their attention long enough to hook, line and swoosh &#8216;em into your world for the long term. &#8216;Til dentures do us part.</p>
<p>These days, things are different. My blog is <em>entirely responsible</em> for my success in the copywriting industry. That&#8217;s not an exaggeration, or a feeble attempt at sounding like I know what I&#8217;m talking about. That&#8217;s fact.</p>
<p>Typically I post around two to three times a week, but I have a dirty little secret to share: While the bread and butter of my business is copywriting, <em>I don&#8217;t blog about copywriting</em>.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t blog about copywriting for a number of reasons, but the primary one is that my clients <em>don&#8217;t care about copywriting.</em> And honestly? Your clients don&#8217;t care about what you do, either.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a mistake I see often made—well-meaning businesses trying to blog about their business. The reason it&#8217;s a mistake is because, again, your clients don&#8217;t care about your business; they don&#8217;t even care about what you can do for them, per se.</p>
<p><em>What they care about is feeling better any time they interact with you and your content</em>. While it may sound oversimplified, this is key.</p>
<p>Whether <em>feeling better</em> translates into them having more confidence in themselves, having more confidence that you&#8217;ll be the solution to their problem, or just feeling inspired by your message, this really is the key to running a successful blog and, by extension, consulting business.</p>
<p>One thing I can promise you is this: <em>the blogger who makes his reader feel less alone and more understood wins this game—and wins the business.</em> Because it&#8217;s <em>that blogger</em> who will create excitement, and it&#8217;s <em>that blogger</em> who will ultimately give the world a reason to actually care about his message.</p>
<p>And didn&#8217;t I mention that was step one? Wink.</p>
<h2>So how do <em>I</em> pull it off at The Middle Finger Project?</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ll tell you how.</p>
<p>The Middle Finger Project isn&#8217;t just a blog; it&#8217;s its own movement, so to speak. It isn&#8217;t the blog itself—it&#8217;s what the blog <em>represents</em> for my readers and customers. Hope. Hope there <em>is</em> more out there, and it isn&#8217;t too late to come alive and <em>be the person you were meant to be</em>. It has nothing to do with copywriting; it&#8217;s about having fun in this one racy little speck of life we&#8217;re given, and doing what our anxiety-bent insides are mercilessly clawing at us to do.</p>
<p>For one set of my customers, this often means starting their own businesses—then, at that point, my copywriting services are there to support them in making that leap. Another set of customers—for example, my tech start ups—hire me because they, too, tend to be forward-thinking companies led by entrepreneurs who can relate to the core message of TMFproject as well.</p>
<p>The take away here?</p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t just blog</h2>
<p>Think about what your blog represents, and how you can connect it to the underlying beliefs and values of your target readers or customers—and how this can help them get excited and <em>care about you.</em></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a divorce lawyer, don&#8217;t blog about divorce. Blog about the inspirational stories that come out of divorce. Blog about the client who found herself again. Blog about the client who reawakened his love for bowling. Blog about the client who re-married her husband for a second time. Blog about the client who found his real soul mate the second time around.</p>
<p>Give your clients a reason to get excited—<em>and feel better.</em> Give &#8216;em a reason to want to read. And once they want to read, they&#8217;ll naturally want <em>you.</em></p>
<p>And only when they <em>want you,</em> are you then in a position to successfully sell them your services.</p>
<p>Then, it&#8217;s just a matter of aligning your service offerings with the things that you know will make your customers <em>feel better</em>—about their lives, about their futures, about their businesses, or about their decision to choose <em>you</em> over the next guy.</p>
<h2>Making it work</h2>
<p>For example, one of my most successful offerings at The Middle Finger Project has been the <a href="http://www.themiddlefingerproject.org/shop/one-night-stand/">One Night Stand</a>—a rapid-fire copywriting service for those who need hot web copy that sells, at a price that won&#8217;t send them hurtling into debt with no pants on. (We like to, <em>ahem</em>, save our debt for things like Victoria&#8217;s Secret and The Cheesecake Factory.)</p>
<p>The reason it&#8217;s been so successful is two-fold. First, clients feel better because they&#8217;re gaining confidence that their business or website is going to be successful, since mouth-watering copy is one of the most important pillars of any online space. But second, this offering has been a success because I deliberately have made it <em>fun</em>—and fun always wins over not fun, as any kindergartener will confirm. And who wouldn&#8217;t want to go with the service provider that&#8217;s guaranteed to make a more pleasant—and exciting—experience for their client?</p>
<p>For example, I could have just called this, “Copywriting service,” but I didn&#8217;t, and deliberately so. I named it the One Night Stand, and furthermore went on to label each part of the service as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Innocent Flirting, AKA Pre-Session Jamming</li>
<li>Intimate Discussion: 1-hour call on the day of our session</li>
<li>Down + Dirty Sweat Sesh: Up to five pages of cunningly cool copy</li>
<li>Nightcap + Pillow Talk: Your Feedback</li>
<li>Oops, You Forgot Your Panties: One round of final edits</li>
</ul>
<p>While the simple act of naming of a product or service might seem trivial—and is often an afterthought—it isn&#8217;t just about naming. It&#8217;s about the anticipated <em>experience.</em> I know my customers intimately (look who&#8217;s got puns!), and I knew that this type of offering would be something they&#8217;d not only get a kick out of, but would be racing to purchase particularly because of the element of fun that The Middle Finger Project brand has become known for. And a fresh start, with fun at the helm, is what many of my clients are so desperately craving.</p>
<p>Moving forward, The Middle Finger Project will continue to stand for having more fun than everyone else, in both life and business.</p>
<p>Registration has just closed for a six-week online copywriting workshop I&#8217;ll be hosting, and before the year is out, <em>The Middle Finger Project</em> (the book) will be released: because life is short and vodka tastes better abroad.</p>
<h2>Selling consulting through your blog</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m beyond honored to have the opportunity to make a living doing what I do—the (mostly) prim and proper chick rocking the hell out of a rebel&#8217;s brand. Yet, it all started that fall afternoon in 2009 when I began the blog as a way to build a platform, connect like-minded folks, and really give the world a run for its money.</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s about standing up for what you believe in—and rallying others to do the same.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s about reaching for your megaphone—and not just expecting attention, but going out and <em>grabbing it.</em></li>
<li>It&#8217;s about helping people care—first about themselves, and then about you.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s about generating excitement—from your message to your brand to every single thing you sell.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s about remembering that every single one of us is human—and most of us just really want to feel understood.</li>
<li>And above all, it&#8217;s about getting off your backside, and making it happen already.</li>
</ul>
<p>You got this. Roseanne Barr and I believe in you.</p>
<p><em>*I&#8217;ve never actually dated a French man, therefore that statement was partially false. Okay, <em>entirely false</em>. However, I do imagine that I would thoroughly enjoy one.</em></p>

My background is in food science. I used design chocolate biscuits for a living—for Australia&#8217;s largest biscuit manufacturer.</p>
<p>I love everything to do with food, so it was only natural that after getting addicted to reading food blogs, I took the leap to starting my own.</p>
<p><strong>Your blog supports online training product offerings. Did you develop the blog first, and then adopt that business model, or develop the business first, then build the blog?</strong></p>
<p>It was blog first for me. I had no idea where blogging would lead me, or that it was even possible to use a blog to make money online. It wasn&#8217;t until I&#8217;d been blogging for a few years that I came across the idea of turning a blog into a business.</p>
<p><strong>And at what point did online cooking classes appear as an ideal product idea? Did you always think that that might be the way to go, or did you need to be convinced of the model&#8217;s viability first?</strong></p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until I saw a class on the A-List Blogging Bootcamps called something like &#8220;Create Courses that Sell&#8221; that I even had the idea. But as soon as I had that &#8220;a-ha&#8221; moment, I decided to give it a shot.</p>
<p>Cooking is something that works really well on TV and video, so I figured it would translate well into a class format. (Although if we could get someone to invent &#8216;scratch and sniff&#8217; video that would be even better!)</p>
<p>Ultimately, it was an organic evolution of my blog—that was just how it happened. There was no grand (or evil!) master plan.</p>
<p><strong>Great. So in what ways does blogging support your training offerings?</strong></p>
<p>Primarily, my blog attracts customers to buy my ebooks and my online cooking classes. It&#8217;s a way of developing a relationship with my readers to turn them into buyers.</p>
<p>That being said, my blog also works as an online business card. I have a book coming out next year because of my blog—my publisher discovered Stonesoup and contacted me about doing a book. It also works for speaking gigs, and I&#8217;ve done a bit of freelance writing based on contacts from my blogging.</p>
<p><strong>What kinds of challenges do you face in using your blog to build your business?</strong></p>
<p>At the moment, my biggest challenge is moving away from making most of my money when I launch a new cooking class to a more continuous (and sustainable) model. I haven&#8217;t figured out how I&#8217;m going to do it, but I think building a process with email marketing at the centre will be part of the solution.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also struggling with conversions. For the amount of readers and traffic I get, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m doing a good job of turning them into paying customers.</p>
<p><strong>So what converts best for you: your ebook or your courses? Do you think the blog reading marketplace is saturated with certain format offerings?</strong></p>
<p>In terms of overall revenue, about 50% of my income comes from ebooks and 50% from courses. So even though ebooks are cheaper and convert better, the total income is about the same as the higher priced classes.</p>
<p>In terms of saturation, I think there&#8217;s always a market for high-quality products that solve real problems for people, regardless of the offering format.</p>
<p><strong>You mention price. How did you work out how to price your classes?</strong></p>
<p>Pricing is something I&#8217;m still experimenting with. At the beginning, I thought about what other classes cost, then considered what I thought I&#8217;d be prepared to pay for a course, and took it from there.</p>
<p><strong>What are the key elements that have helped you get to where you are with your blog?</strong></p>
<p>Passion! It&#8217;s a bit of a cliche, but in my case it&#8217;s totally true. I love cooking, writing about food, and taking photographs of what I cook. I can&#8217;t imagine doing anything else and enjoying it as much as I love working on my blog and my business.</p>
<p>Consistency has also been key. I promised myself when I started I would publish at least once every week and I&#8217;ve been doing that right from the beginning.</p>
<p>The quest for continuous improvement is also important. I&#8217;m not a perfectionist by any standards but I&#8217;m always thinking of how I can do things better.</p>
<p><strong>That&#8217;s interesting. How do you continuously improve your courses? What&#8217;s involved in that process—from a content perspective, but also from product integrity and delivery viewpoints?</strong></p>
<p>I ask my students for feedback. After I run a major class I do a short survey using Survey Monkey to collect testimonials and also get feedback on what worked and what needs improvement.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also started running a Poll Daddy quiz on my cooking school site so my students actually vote for the topic of the next class. Actually, you&#8217;ve just reminded me I&#8217;ve been meaning to set up a feedback option on the site using something like <a href="http://uservoice.com/" target="_blank">uservoice.com</a> so it&#8217;s really easy for my students to give feedback, get help, and make suggestions.</p>
<p><strong>Cooking&#8217;s a very cluttered niche. What&#8217;s unique about the way you&#8217;ve developed your offering?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m all about simplicity. All my recipes have only five ingredients and deliver big when it comes to flavour and healthiness.</p>
<p><strong>And have you carried that philosophy through to your cooking classes?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely! Simplicity is really a core philosophy of my life, so even if I wanted to do a &#8220;fancy&#8221; or &#8220;complicated&#8221; cooking class, I wouldn&#8217;t be able to do it.</p>
<p><strong>Right. So you mentioned Survey Monkey and uservoice, but what other tools or services do you rely on as you develop your business?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m using:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aweber for email list management</li>
<li>Clickbank for selling products and their affiliate network</li>
<li>Visual Website Optimizer for split testing (although I&#8217;ve had a few issues recently with them).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What tools do you use specifically in developing and delivering your courses?</strong></p>
<p>At first I had a little flip video camera for making my videos but I&#8217;ve since upgraded to a Nikon D7000 for recording video. And I just use  imovie for editing videos. And then in terms of my membership site management, it&#8217;s a WordPress blog using the plugin <a href="http://member.wishlistproducts.com/">Wishlist Member</a>.</p>
<p><strong>And how did you go about researching and sourcing those tools?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m very lazy when it comes to researching things like that, and I&#8217;m pretty sure the flip cam and Wishlist Member were what was recommended in the &#8220;Create Courses that Sell&#8221; class I took.</p>
<p><strong>What advice, tips, and insider secrets would you give to someone who was just starting out with a blog business model based around selling training?</strong></p>
<p>Get your own product out there sooner rather than later. I made the mistake of quitting my job and then not launching my first product for seven months, so there was no income coming in.</p>
<p>That was fine, but I would have been much better off to get something out there and start learning how to market etc. sooner rather than later. It&#8217;s definitely one of those things that you can only get really great at if you keep trying different things.</p>
<p><strong>Interesting! So what does the future hold for Stonesoup and your course offering?</strong></p>
<p>Hopefully lots more sales! And I&#8217;d like to have things more automated so I can step back a bit and spend more time in my veggie garden and less time in front of a computer screen.</p>

<p>As we&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2012/06/29/blog-business-models-4-affiliate-marketing/">already seen today</a>, affiliate marketing is a relatively trouble-free way for bloggers and other website owners to earn money. In fact, these days, even social media sites can become lucrative platforms for affiliate marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>Because affiliate marketing doesn&#8217;t require affiliates to offer their own products or services for purchase, but only to place promotions on their sites for other merchants&#8217; products, it frees affiliates from many of the responsibilities and complications of traditional sales models.</p>
<p>Affiliate marketing programs typically work by having the merchant handle all the logistics involved in selling products or services, processing customer orders and payments, and shipping merchandise—all while the affiliate sits back and collects a commission for each agreed-upon action completed by the visitors the affiliate sends to the merchant&#8217;s website via an affiliate link. As long as the affiliate has done her homework and chosen a trustworthy affiliate program, she needn&#8217;t worry about non-payment.</p>
<p>Affiliate networks administer programs for individual merchants, handling all the work involved, while generally providing tracking and reporting capabilities to their affiliates to help them keep tabs on their revenues and determine which products or services are producing the best returns. These tools can be helpful to an affiliate in fine-tuning the line of products she decides to promote on her site and, ideally, increasing revenues as a result.</p>
<p>However, all affiliate programs are not created equal. Which are the most popular programs available today?</p>
<h2>1. <a href="http://www.linkshare.com/advertisers/affiliate/">LinkShare</a></h2>
<p>Reportedly the largest affiliate network, with over 10 million affiliate partnerships, LinkShare took the number-one spot in the <a href="http://mthink.com/bluebook/content/top20/affiliate">2012 Blue Book of Top 20 Affiliate Networks</a> for platform strength, support quality, and international capabilities.</p>
<p>LinkShare offers over 2,500 affiliate programs and lets you choose whether to have every aspect of your affiliate channel managed for you or whether you would rather manage your own program using the company&#8217;s various service and support options.</p>
<h2>2. <a href="http://www.cj.com/">Commission Junction</a></h2>
<p>Said to be the largest affiliate marketing network in North America (though it operates globally) and claiming the number-two spot in the 2012 Blue Book of Top 20 Affiliate Networks for being &#8220;the best at balancing the relationship between the merchants, the network, and the affiliates,&#8221; California-based Commission Junction, owned by ValueClick, Inc., offers affiliate, media, and tracking services and provides either a self-management or company-managed option for your affiliate relationships.</p>
<p>In addition to its regular pay-per-action affiliate program, the company also offers a convenient PayPerCall program to help affiliates &#8220;ensure they get paid commission for the leads they generate, thus further monetizing existing ad placements and having the opportunity to expand their promotional…online and offline campaigns.&#8221;</p>
<h2>3. <a href="http://www.shareasale.com/">ShareASale</a></h2>
<p>Claiming the number-three spot in the 2012 Blue Book of Top 20 Affiliate Networks for being the &#8220;overall best performance marketing network in the world today,&#8221; Chicago-based ShareASale has over 2,500 merchant programs and features brands such as HootSuite and PS Print. </p>
<p>ShareASale has received <a href="http://www.aceaffiliates.com/retail/shareasale.html">excellent ratings</a>, with the company&#8217;s reputation/security, ethics, customer service, and ease of commission payment receiving glowing reviews.</p>
<h2>4. <a href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/">Amazon Associates</a></h2>
<p>Placing fourth in the 2012 Blue Book of Top 20 Affiliate Networks, for a reporting system that &#8220;far surpasses other big networks,&#8221; this is one of the largest and most diverse affiliate programs available. </p>
<p>As most people know, Amazon.com offers such a wide array of products that there&#8217;s bound to be <em>something</em> to fit your niche. In fact, they offer over a million products from which you can choose to monetize your website or blog. Amazon Associates is a pay-per-sale affiliate program.</p>
<h2>5. <a href="http://www.google.com/ads/affiliatenetwork/">Google Affiliate Network</a></h2>
<p>According to the network&#8217;s Overview page, &#8220;Google Affiliate Network helps advertisers increase online conversions on a performance basis and enables publishers to monetize traffic with affiliate ads.&#8221; </p>
<p>Google Affiliate Network is a pay-per-action network that pays commissions to its affiliates for driving conversions (sales or leads). The network requires a Google AdSense account for posting ads to the affiliate&#8217;s website or blog and facilitating affiliate payments.</p>
<h2>6. <a href="http://www.clixgalore.com/">ClixGalore</a></h2>
<p>ClixGalore is an Australian PPA (pay-per-action) affiliate network that also has offices in the US, UK, and Japan. The company offers various types of programs, including PPM (pay-per-impression), PPL (pay per lead), PPS (pay-per-sale), and PPC (pay-per-click). Many programs pay in US dollars. </p>
<p>Some well-known brands that use ClixGalore for their affiliate offerings are Bluehost, Time Life, Trend Micro, Citibank, and Fox Sports Shop. While not as widely known as some of the other affiliate networks, ClixGalore is a solid network that offers thousands of potential merchant programs. The network also offers a two-tier network. By referring other affiliates to the network, current affiliates can receive a portion of their earnings.</p>
<h2>7. <a href="http://peerfly.com/">PeerFly.com</a></h2>
<p>PeerFly is a PPA network with its own proprietary software system. The network made the 2012 Blue Book of Top 20 Affiliate Networks, which stated regarding them, &#8220;They are courteous, helpful, and point you in the right direction.&#8221; </p>
<p>The network also took the number-four spot in the <a href="http://mthink.com/bluebook/top20/cpa">2012 Blue Book of Top 20 CPA Networks</a>, for its high popularity, great staff, and excellent platform. PeerFly accepts publishers from all over the world and offers thousands of merchant programs.</p>
<h2>8. <a href="http://www.clickbank.com/index.html">ClickBank</a></h2>
<p>A well-known affiliate network, ClickBank features digital products, such as e-books, software, and membership sites. The program reportedly offers up to 75% commissions on its tens of thousands of products. Commissions are paid weekly, and direct deposit is available to its affiliates. </p>
<p>Over the years, this network has <a href="http://www.imreportcard.com/services/clickbank">remained popular</a>, though some have <a href="http://www.linktrackr.com/blog/clickbank-review/">questioned a few of its practices</a>. Despite this, the company enjoys an <a href="http://www.bbb.org/boise/business-reviews/internet-shopping/clickbank-in-boise-id-5004291/">A- rating with the Better Business Bureau</a>.</li>
<h2>9. <a href="http://www.maxbounty.com/">MaxBounty</a></h2>
<p>MaxBounty came in sixth in the 2012 Blue Book of Top 20 CPA Networks, though it didn&#8217;t make a showing in the Blue Book&#8217;s top 20 affiliate networks. In business since 2004, the network was founded on the philosophy of paying its affiliates more. </p>
<p>MaxBounty pays affiliate commissions weekly, and the company appears to have a good reputation among its affiliates. In fact, the network is popular among many top affiliate marketers and has received <a href="http://www.leadcrunch.com/?tag=maxbounty">numerous positive reviews</a> and <a href="http://www.imreportcard.com/services/maxbounty">writeups</a> and <a href="http://jaysonlinereviews.com/max-bounty-review-c-p-a-network-paid-action/">critiques</a> over the past several years.</li>
<h2>10. <a href="http://www.neverblue.com/affiliates/benefits">Neverblue.com</a></h2>
<p>Neverblue is a pay-per-action affiliate program that pays its affiliates for lead, download, and sale generation, as well as for new affiliate referrals. While Neverblue didn&#8217;t make the 2012 Blue Book of Top 20 Affiliate Networks, it did take the number-one spot in the 2012 Blue Book of Top 20 CPA Networks.</p>
<p>Note: Neverblue&#8217;s parent company, Velo Holdings, Inc, <a href="http://performinsider.com/2012/04/neverblue-files-for-bankruptcy/">filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy</a> earlier this year and now plans to <a href="http://performinsider.com/2012/06/neverblue-to-be-sold-at-auction-to-pay-debts/">sell the network at auction to pay its debts</a>.</p>
<p>Despite this, the affiliate program has stated the following: &#8220;This filing will not impact Neverblue’s ability to meet client needs in any way—we intend to continue to operate business as usual without interruption. Neverblue’s business is fundamentally strong and we intend to make all affiliate payments on schedule, in a timely and reliable manner.&#8221; </p>
<p>Its management is just as confident that the sale will not affect Neverblue&#8217;s ability to meet its affiliates&#8217; needs in any way. While this company tends to inspire high confidence among affiliates, you&#8217;ll have to decide whether to jump in now or wait a while to see how things go after the sale.</p>
